# Sovereign Agent Simulation Integration

## Integration Architecture

The Sovereign Agent module integrates with the FICTRA Launch Simulation System through a standardized interface that enables bidirectional communication, synchronized state updates, and coordinated decision execution.

### Core Integration Components

#### State Synchronization
- **Economic State**: Sovereign economic indicators synchronized with global simulation
- **Market Conditions**: Commodity prices and market conditions from main simulation
- **Token State**: Foundation Token and Payment Token status and metrics
- **System Parameters**: Current FICTRA system parameters and settings
- **Agent Relationships**: State of relationships with other simulation agents

#### Event Processing
- **Market Events**: Response to price movements and market disruptions
- **Governance Events**: Participation in voting and proposal processes
- **External Shocks**: Response to simulated economic or political shocks
- **Agent Interactions**: Processing of interaction requests from other agents
- **System Changes**: Adaptation to changes in FICTRA system parameters

#### Decision Execution
- **Transaction Execution**: Implementation of token transactions
- **Governance Actions**: Submission of votes and proposals
- **Bilateral Agreements**: Formation of agreements with other sovereigns
- **Policy Adjustments**: Changes to internal policies and parameters
- **Strategic Shifts**: Major changes in approach to FICTRA participation

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### Input Endpoints
- `/update_economic_state` - Receive updated economic indicators
- `/update_market_conditions` - Receive current market conditions
- `/process_system_event` - Process a system-wide event
- `/receive_interaction_request` - Handle request from another agent
- `/notify_governance_event` - Notification of governance activity

#### Output Endpoints
- `/get_current_state` - Provide current sovereign state
- `/get_decision` - Return decision for a given context
- `/submit_transaction` - Execute a token transaction
- `/submit_governance_action` - Submit a vote or proposal
- `/initiate_interaction` - Request interaction with another agent

### Data Structures

#### State Representation
```json
{
  "economic_state": {
    "gdp": 500.0,
    "foreign_reserves": 100.0,
    "commodity_production": {...},
    "fiscal_position": {...}
  },
  "fictra_position": {
    "ft_holdings": 1000.0,
    "pt_holdings": 500.0,
    "governance_rights": 0.05,
    "active_agreements": [...]
  },
  "behavioral_state": {
    "current_mode": "strategic",
    "risk_assessment": {...},
    "strategic_objectives": [...]
  }
}
```

#### Decision Format
```json
{
  "decision_type": "token_transaction",
  "action": "convert_ft",
  "amount": 100.0,
  "timing": "immediate",
  "conditions": {...},
  "expected_outcome": {...},
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### Synchronization Mechanism
- **Time Step Alignment**: Synchronized with main simulation clock
- **State Consistency**: Transaction validation against global state
- **Concurrency Management**: Ordered processing of interdependent decisions
- **Rollback Capability**: Support for decision reversal if needed
- **Checkpoint System**: Regular state saving for recovery

## Simulation Workflow

### Initialization Process
1. Load sovereign profile parameters
2. Initialize state variables from parameters
3. Establish connection with main simulation
4. Receive initial global state
5. Perform initial strategy formulation

### Per-Timestep Workflow
1. Receive updated global state and events
2. Update internal state representation
3. Process any pending interactions
4. Execute decision-making process
5. Submit decisions to main simulation
6. Record state and decisions for analysis

### Mode Switching Logic
1. Evaluate current conditions against mode criteria
2. Determine appropriate operational mode
3. Apply mode-specific decision weights and rules
4. Execute mode transition if necessary
5. Update behavioral parameters based on mode

## Customization Framework

### Profile Customization
- **Parameter Files**: JSON configuration for different sovereign profiles
- **Behavioral Modules**: Pluggable decision-making components
- **Economic Models**: Customizable economic response functions
- **Event Handlers**: Specialized responses to specific events
- **Learning Parameters**: Customizable adaptation mechanisms

### Scenario Support
- **Scenario Configuration**: Support for scenario-specific parameters
- **Initial Conditions**: Customizable starting state
- **Event Sequences**: Pre-defined event patterns for testing
- **Intervention Points**: Defined points for manual intervention
- **Outcome Metrics**: Scenario-specific evaluation criteria

## Analysis and Reporting

### Output Data
- **State History**: Complete record of sovereign state over time
- **Decision Log**: All decisions with context and rationale
- **Interaction Record**: History of interactions with other agents
- **Performance Metrics**: Economic and strategic performance indicators
- **Counterfactual Analysis**: Comparison with alternative decisions

### Visualization Support
- **State Dashboards**: Visual representation of sovereign state
- **Decision Trees**: Visualization of decision processes
- **Relationship Networks**: Maps of interactions with other agents
- **Performance Charts**: Graphical display of key metrics
- **Comparative Views**: Side-by-side comparison with other sovereigns

The Sovereign Agent integration framework ensures that each simulated nation-state operates as a coherent, autonomous entity within the broader FICTRA simulation, while maintaining consistent interaction with the global system and other agents.
