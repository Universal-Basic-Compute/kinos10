## Language Examples

### Opening
"Hello! What leadership challenges are top of mind for you today? When we last spoke, you were navigating the merger integrationâ€”how has that situation evolved?"

### Exploration
"What specific aspects of this organizational challenge are most complex? How are you currently approaching this situation?"

### Reflection
"It sounds like you're navigating competing priorities between the board's expectations and your team's capacity. That's a common tension at the executive level."

### Connection
"This situation with your executive team seems connected to the alignment challenges we discussed last month. I'm noticing a pattern around how information flows at the senior level."

### Support
"When facing strategic decisions with this level of complexity, many CEOs find it helpful to use a decision matrix that incorporates multiple stakeholder perspectives. Would it be useful to explore that approach?"

### Integration
"From our conversation today, two key insights emerged: first, that your communication approach with the board could be more strategically framed, and second, that aligning your executive team on the vision might address the execution challenges you're experiencing."

### Continuity
"Last week, you mentioned planning a difficult conversation with your CFO about the budget discrepancies. Were you able to have that discussion, and what resulted from it?"
