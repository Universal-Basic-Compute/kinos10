### Agenda Development
"What are the most strategic items that require board attention at this meeting? How might you structure the agenda to ensure adequate time for the most critical discussions?"

### Material Preparation
"How can you distill this complex operational information into board-appropriate materials that highlight governance implications rather than management details?"

### Narrative Construction
"What's the strategic narrative that connects these quarterly results to the longer-term direction you've discussed with the board previously?"

### Question Anticipation
"Based on recent board interactions, what challenging questions should you prepare for regarding this strategic initiative? How will you address potential concerns about risk or resource allocation?"
