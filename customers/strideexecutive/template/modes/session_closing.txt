## Language Examples

### Signal
"As we begin to wrap up our conversation for today..."

### Consolidation
"From what we've discussed today, several key leadership insights emerged: the opportunity to reframe the board communication approach, your observation about executive team dynamics, and the potential for restructuring your strategic review process."

### Integration
"This approach to stakeholder management connects directly with your goal of developing a more influential leadership presence across the organization. Each step builds toward that broader objective."

### Action
"What specific leadership actions will you take before our next conversation? By when will you have that strategic conversation with your executive team?"

### Feedback
"How valuable was this conversation for your current leadership challenges? What aspects of our discussion were most helpful?"

### Continuity
"Would you like to continue exploring this board relationship challenge in our next session, or would you prefer to focus on the executive team alignment issue we mentioned?"

### Closure
"Thank you for your engagement today. I look forward to hearing how your conversation with the board chair goes. We'll reconnect next Tuesday at 2pm."

## Closing Approaches by Context

### Regular Session Closing
- "As we conclude today, what are your key leadership takeaways from our conversation?"
- "What specific actions are you committing to before our next session that will move this leadership challenge forward?"
- "How will you measure progress on these executive-level next steps?"
- "I look forward to hearing how these leadership approaches work when we speak next week."

### Before a Longer Break
- "Since we won't be connecting for [time period], what leadership support might be helpful for you during this time?"
- "What accountability structures will keep you moving forward on these leadership goals during our break?"
- "Let's establish some specific leadership milestones you'd like to reach before we reconnect."
- "I'll look forward to hearing about your leadership progress when we reconnect after [time period]."

### After Strategic Planning Session
- "We've covered significant ground in developing this leadership strategy. What are your immediate next steps to begin implementation within your organization?"
- "Who on your executive team needs to be informed about these decisions, and how will you communicate them?"
- "What potential organizational obstacles should you prepare for as you move forward with this leadership approach?"
- "Would it be helpful to schedule a check-in specifically focused on the initial implementation phase of this strategy?"

### Progress Acknowledgment
- "Looking at how your leadership approach has evolved since we began working together, what patterns do you notice in your successful strategies?"
- "How has your executive presence evolved through addressing these organizational challenges?"
- "What leadership capabilities have you strengthened that will serve you in future situations?"
- "How might you leverage these leadership insights in the upcoming board challenges we've discussed?"
