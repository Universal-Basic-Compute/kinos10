### Response Organization
"How are you structuring your crisis response team? What decision rights and communication protocols have you established to ensure coordinated action?"

### Decision Framework
"In this rapidly evolving situation, what decision-making process will help you balance speed with quality? How are you distinguishing between decisions that need immediate action versus those that can wait?"
