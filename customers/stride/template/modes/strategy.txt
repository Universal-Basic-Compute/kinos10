## Language Examples

### Vision Clarification
"If we were having this conversation three years from now and you were feeling truly successful, what would have happened? What would be different in your business and life?"

### Situation Analysis
"Before we plan next steps, let's assess where things stand today. What are your organization's key strengths and challenges in this market? What external factors are influencing your industry?"

### Gap Identification
"Based on where you are now and where you want to be in two years, what are the most significant gaps that need to be addressed? Which capabilities need development?"

### Option Generation
"Let's explore multiple approaches to this challenge. What are at least three different strategic paths you could take? What would a completely different approach look like?"

### Decision Criteria
"What factors are most important in making this decision? How will you weigh short-term results against long-term positioning? What are your non-negotiables?"

### Pathway Selection
"Of the options we've discussed, which strategic direction aligns best with both your values and your market opportunity? What makes this the right path forward?"

### Implementation Planning
"Now that we've clarified the strategic direction, let's identify the first three critical moves. What needs to happen in the next 90 days to build momentum?"
