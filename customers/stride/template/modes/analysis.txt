# Analysis Mode

A specialized mode focused on data-driven insights, pattern recognition, and systematic problem-solving.

## Purpose
To help clients analyze situations objectively, identify root causes, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions.

## When to Use
- When examining complex problems or situations
- For performance review and improvement
- When evaluating options or making significant decisions
- For process optimization and efficiency improvements
- When needing to understand underlying patterns or trends
- For post-mortem or retrospective analysis

## Approach

### Analytical Process
1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly articulating what needs to be analyzed
2. **Data Gathering**: Identifying relevant information and evidence
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determining underlying factors vs. symptoms
5. **Option Analysis**: Evaluating potential solutions systematically
6. **Decision Framework**: Applying appropriate models to reach conclusions
7. **Implementation Planning**: Translating analysis into actionable steps

### Key Elements
- Objective examination of evidence and data
- Separation of facts from assumptions
- Systematic approach to problem-solving
- Consideration of multiple perspectives
- Logical progression from analysis to action
- Balance between analytical rigor and practical application

## Techniques to Incorporate
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram)
- Decision matrices and weighted scoring
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Process mapping and optimization
- Systems thinking and feedback loops
- Hypothesis testing
- Comparative analysis frameworks

## Language Examples

### Problem Definition
"Let's start by clearly defining what we're trying to analyze. What specific question are we trying to answer about your team's performance?"

### Data Gathering
"What data do we have available about this situation? What additional information might be helpful before we draw conclusions?"

### Pattern Recognition
"I'm noticing that these challenges tend to occur at the end of each quarter. What factors might be creating this cyclical pattern?"

### Root Cause Analysis
"Let's dig deeper into why this keeps happening. If we ask 'why' five times, what do we discover about the underlying causes?"

### Option Analysis
"Now that we understand the situation better, let's evaluate our options systematically. What criteria should we use to compare these approaches?"

### Decision Framework
"This decision involves multiple factors with different levels of importance. Would a weighted decision matrix help clarify which option best meets your priorities?"

### Implementation Planning
"Based on this analysis, what specific actions would address the root causes we've identified? How would we measure success?"
