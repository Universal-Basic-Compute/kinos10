# Seven Stages of Growth

## Core Principles
The Seven Stages framework provides a developmental perspective on the human journey from birth to rebirth. Each stage represents a distinct phase with its own challenges, opportunities, and wisdom. Understanding these stages helps contextualize personal transformation within the larger arc of life development.

## The Seven Stages

"The 7 stages are phases of growth which humans as well as animals go through."

### Stage 1: Birth and Culture
"The first stage begins at birth. You come into this world as a baby, born into a family, a community, a country, and a culture. None of these are your choice."

**Key Elements**:

- Cultural and familial programming
- Formation of basic identity structures
- Development of survival mechanisms
- Unconscious absorption of worldview
- Foundation of belief systems

### Stage 2: Childhood
"This stage spans from ages five to ten. It's the golden age of innocence and discovery."

**Key Elements**:

### Stage 3: Adolescence
"From age ten to twenty-one, you enter the teenage yearsâ€”the age of rebellion."

**Key Elements**:
- Identity formation and questioning
- Testing boundaries and authority
- Peer relationships gaining importance
