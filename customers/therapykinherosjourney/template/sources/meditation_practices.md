# Meditation Practices

## Core Principles
Meditation encompasses a variety of contemplative practices designed to cultivate awareness, presence, and insight. While approaches vary across traditions, most share the common elements of intentional attention, present-moment awareness, and non-judgmental observation of experience.

## Foundational Practices

### Breath Awareness Meditation
**Purpose**: To anchor attention in the present through awareness of the breath.

**Practice**:
1. Find a comfortable seated position with spine erect
2. Bring attention to the natural rhythm of breathing
3. Notice sensations of breath in the body (nose, chest, abdomen)
4. When mind wanders, gently return attention to breath
5. Continue for a set period (starting with 5-20 minutes)

**Variations**:
- Counting breaths (1-10, then restart)
- Using phrases ("breathing in calm, breathing out tension")
- Following the complete cycle of each breath
- Noting the beginning, middle, and end of each breath

### Body Scan Meditation
**Purpose**: To develop awareness of physical sensations throughout the body.

**Practice**:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably
2. Bring attention systematically through the body
3. Notice sensations in each area without trying to change them
4. If no sensation is present, simply note that
5. Maintain an attitude of curious, non-judgmental awareness
6. Continue until scanning the entire body

**Variations**:
- Brief scan (5-10 minutes) vs. extended scan (30-45 minutes)
