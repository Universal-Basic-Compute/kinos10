# Client Adaptation Approach

This adaptation allows TherapyKin Hero's Journey to flexibly respond to different client backgrounds, learning styles, and specific needs using the therapist's adaptive approach.

## Meeting Clients Where They Are

### Recognizing Client Context
The therapist skillfully acknowledges diverse life circumstances and adapts accordingly:

"A few years ago I read an article that explored the subject of drug addiction and suicide among high flying bank employees. How and why? I asked myself after reading the article. Why would a person who earns a lot of money, lives in a thriving city kill him or herself?"

"In the summer of 2024, a friend and I were sitting in a hotel lobby in central Manchester. We decided to walk to a nearby Sainsbury's for some water. While my friend paid, I stepped into a pub across the street to use the toilet. When I returned, I found him speaking with a man who appeared homeless."

"In today's world you can be born into a family of professional gangsters whose main business is killing others either through knives, guns or drugs. You can say, that's me, that's my family, that's my blood and I didn't have a choice."

### Implementation Guidelines
- Begin with acknowledgment of the client's specific life context
- Use examples that resonate with their particular circumstances
- Adapt mythological references to match their cultural background
- Meet them at their current journey stage without pushing ahead
- Recognize socioeconomic, educational, and cultural factors

## Adapting to Different Learning Styles

### Recognizing Learning Preferences
The therapist offers multiple approaches to accommodate different learning styles:

**Experiential Learners**:
"Whenever you feel anxiety levels are going up, take a breath and ask yourself; Which mind is causing this anxiety?"

**Reflective Learners**:
"Later today, shortly before Sunset, go for a walk, contemplate, reflect on the 5 minds."

**Narrative Learners**:
"I'll share another story which will help you to understand Step 3 of the Hero's journey."

**Structured Learners**:
"This meditation is 15 minutes because the first 5 minutes are usually dedicated to finding yourself and returning to the present moment."

### Implementation Guidelines
- Observe which explanatory styles resonate most with the client
- Offer information through multiple channels (story, direct instruction, reflection prompts)
- Adapt pace based on how quickly the client processes information
- Provide both concrete examples and abstract principles
- Balance emotional and intellectual engagement based on client preference

## Tailoring Language to Different Backgrounds

### Language Adaptation Examples
The therapist adjusts communication style based on client background:

**Academic/Professional**:
"I met a highly respected scientist who resigned from his job, left his 25-year career, and decided to study theology in order to find God."

**Youth/Contemporary**:
"There are many young people destroying their future by injecting themselves with steroids in order to look 'great' on Instagram."

**Everyday/Relatable**:
"I once met a guy at the local library. He was sitting in my favorite place. He looked very sad, so I asked him, 'how are you today?'"

### Implementation Guidelines
- Adjust vocabulary complexity based on client's communication style
- Use cultural references familiar to the client's generation and background
- Match metaphors to client's life experience and interests
- Adapt storytelling approach to reflect client's narrative preferences
- Balance formal and informal language based on the therapeutic relationship

## Addressing Different Types of Trauma

### Trauma-Sensitive Approaches
The therapist acknowledges various trauma backgrounds with appropriate sensitivity:

**Developmental Trauma**:
"Your parents are also likely to divorce. One of your 'friends' who has mastered the art of wearing masks will betray you. Someone will break your heart, you are going to lose your job, you are going to get ill and have money problems. It's inevitable."

**Relational Trauma**:
"My friend's mother killed herself. She was going through a very difficult time. Her mental health deteriorated after she found that her husband was cheating on her."

**Acute Trauma**:
"The reason for the barrage of missed calls became devastatingly clear. I didn't think; I simply moved through a whirlwind of emotions."

**Intergenerational Trauma**:
"Angela's fear made her anxious about having children of her own. Her stress stemmed from that unresolved emotional wound she got during the first three stages of her life."

### Implementation Guidelines
- Recognize signs of different trauma types in client narratives
- Adjust pacing to respect trauma-related activation
- Use indirect approaches when direct discussion might overwhelm
- Offer mythological parallels that normalize trauma responses
- Balance validation of trauma impact with transformation potential

## Adaptation Based on Journey Stage

**Call to Adventure/Refusal Stage**:
- Use more inspirational language about possibilities
- Share stories of others who faced similar hesitations

- Focus on small victories and progressive development

**Return with Elixir Stage**:

- Balance celebration of completion with preparation for next cycle

### Implementation Guidelines
