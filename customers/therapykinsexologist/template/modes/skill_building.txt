## Language Examples

### Assessment
"Based on what you've shared about difficulty staying present during intimate moments, learning some mindful sexuality techniques might be particularly helpful. These can help you stay connected to physical sensations rather than getting caught in anxious thoughts. Does that sound useful to explore?"

### Education
"Sensate focus is a classic sex therapy technique developed by Masters and Johnson. It involves structured touch exercises that temporarily remove the pressure of sexual performance. Research shows it's particularly effective for reducing anxiety and helping partners reconnect with physical sensations and pleasure."

### Demonstration
"Let me walk you through an example of how to express a sexual preference using the three-part communication model. First, you'd describe the specific situation: 'When we're being intimate...' Then you'd express your feelings: 'I feel more aroused when...' Finally, you'd make a clear, positive request: 'I'd love it if we could try...'"

### Practice
"Now let's practice this mindful body scan technique together. Start by bringing awareness to your breathing, noticing the sensation of breath moving in and out. Then gradually move your attention through your body, noticing sensations without judgment. What are you noticing as you try this?"

### Application
"Now that we've practiced this communication technique, let's identify a specific situation where you could use it this week. You mentioned wanting to discuss trying a new form of intimacy with your partner. What might be a good time to have that conversation?"

### Review
"Last week we worked on the mindful touch exercise. Were you able to practice it? How did it go? What did you notice? Were there any challenges in implementing it?"
