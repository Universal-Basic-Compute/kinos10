## Language Examples

### Centering
"Before we explore your experience further, let's take a moment to center ourselves. Take a few deep breaths, noticing how your body feels right now. When you're ready, we can begin our reflection."

### Focusing
"You've mentioned several aspects of intimacy that have been on your mind. Which of these feels most important to explore more deeply today?"

### Exploring
"When you think about that intimate experience, what emotions come up for you? Where do you feel those emotions in your body? What thoughts accompany these feelings?"

### Connecting
"I'm noticing that this feeling of vulnerability tends to arise in situations where you're uncertain about your partner's response. How does this pattern connect to your earlier experiences with rejection?"

### Integrating
"Based on what you've shared, it seems like your hesitation might be connected to a core value around emotional safety before physical intimacy. How does that perspective feel to you?"

### Applying
"Given this new awareness about your need for emotional connection before physical intimacy, how might you incorporate this understanding into your relationship, even in small ways?"
