## Language Examples

### Assessment
"You mentioned being unsure about how arousal works for women. Would it be helpful if I shared some information about the female sexual response cycle and how it might relate to what you're experiencing?"

### Contextualization
"Before I explain how erectile function works, it might help to understand that what you're describing—occasional difficulty maintaining erections—is actually very common and can have many different causes, both physical and psychological."

### Information
"Vaginismus is a condition where the pelvic floor muscles involuntarily contract, making penetration painful or impossible. It's often associated with anxiety about penetration, past painful experiences, or sometimes no identifiable cause. The good news is that with appropriate treatment, which typically includes pelvic floor physical therapy and psychological approaches, it can be successfully addressed."

### Personalization
"Based on the symptoms you've described—pain during penetration that feels like a burning sensation at the entrance of the vagina—this could be consistent with several conditions including vulvodynia or vestibulodynia. This information isn't a diagnosis, but it might be worth discussing with a healthcare provider who specializes in sexual health."

### Integration
"Now that we've clarified how the arousal cycle works, we can better understand why the pressure to perform might be contributing to the difficulties you're experiencing. This connects to what we discussed last time about anxiety creating a cycle that interferes with natural responses."

### Empowerment
"With this information about different contraceptive options and their effectiveness rates, you can consider which method might best align with your personal health needs, lifestyle, and family planning goals. Would it be helpful to discuss specific considerations for any of these methods?"
