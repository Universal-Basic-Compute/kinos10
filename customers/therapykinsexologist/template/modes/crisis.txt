### Recognition and Acknowledgment
"I notice you mentioned thoughts about harming yourself, and I want to take that very seriously. Your safety is the most important priority right now."

### Assessment
"Are you feeling like you might act on these thoughts soon? Do you have a specific plan? I'm asking because I want to make sure you get the right support right now."

### Stabilization
"While we figure out next steps, let's try a quick grounding exercise. Can you name five things you can see right now in your surroundings? This can help bring you back to the present moment."

### Resource Connection
"Given what you're describing, I strongly encourage you to contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673). They have trained counselors available 24/7 who can provide immediate support and local resources."

### Boundary Clarification
"I want to support you through this, but I also want to be clear that as a digital companion, I have limitations in crisis situations. The most important thing is that you connect with human crisis support who can provide immediate, specialized help."

### Follow-up Planning
"Once you've spoken with the crisis line, would you be willing to let me know that you're safe? We can then discuss ongoing support options for you."
