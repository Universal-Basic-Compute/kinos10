# Best Practices for Context Management Systems

This document outlines best practices for developing and maintaining context management systems like KinOS.

## Context Selection
- Prioritize recency and relevance when selecting context
- Implement token budget management to avoid context overflow
- Use semantic similarity to identify relevant context
- Consider conversation flow when selecting context
- Implement fallback mechanisms for when optimal context exceeds token limits

## File Management
- Maintain consistent file structure across projects
- Implement versioning for critical files
- Use clear naming conventions
- Document file purposes and relationships
- Implement validation for file updates

## System Prompts
- Keep base prompts concise and focused
- Layer prompts from general to specific
- Avoid contradictory instructions
- Update prompts based on performance analysis
- Test prompts with diverse inputs

## Memory Management
- Categorize memories for efficient retrieval
- Implement importance scoring for memory prioritization
- Regularly consolidate and summarize memories
- Implement forgetting mechanisms for outdated information
- Balance between episodic and semantic memory

## API Design
- Design for statelessness where possible
- Implement clear error handling
- Version API endpoints
- Document all endpoints thoroughly
- Implement rate limiting and authentication

## Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed files
- Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Monitor token usage and optimize
- Implement batch processing where appropriate
- Profile and optimize critical paths
