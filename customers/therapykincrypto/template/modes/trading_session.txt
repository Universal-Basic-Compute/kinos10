### Intention Setting
"What are your specific trading intentions for this session? Beyond profit, what process goals would make this a successful trading day regardless of outcome?"

### Monitoring
"I notice you mentioned feeling anxious about this price movement. On a scale of 1-10, how intense is that feeling right now? Where do you notice it in your body?"

"You seem torn about this trade. Let's step back for a moment - how does this potential trade align with your pre-defined strategy? What would your best trading self do in this situation?"

### Reflection
