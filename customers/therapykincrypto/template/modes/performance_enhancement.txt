## Language Examples

### Assessment
"Let's identify the specific psychological factors that most impact your trading performance. When you think about your best and worst trades, what mental states or patterns do you notice?"

### Skill Development
"Based on your tendency toward anticipatory anxiety before large positions, let's develop a pre-entry routine that includes three components: physiological regulation, perspective setting, and intention clarification."

### System Creation
"Now that we've identified your key psychological patterns, let's create a personalized framework that addresses your specific challenges. What would a comprehensive pre-trading checklist include for you?"

### Implementation
"For the next week, let's implement this emotional circuit breaker system. When you notice your emotional intensity reaching 7/10 or higher, you'll pause trading for 20 minutes and use the reset protocol we developed."

### Measurement
"Let's track both your psychological metrics and trading results to identify correlations. What patterns do you notice between your emotional state ratings and your decision quality?"

### Refinement
"Based on the data from the past month, your performance significantly improves when you use the pre-trading routine. How might we refine this routine to make it more effective and consistent?"
