## Examples

### Day Trader + Aggressive + Technical
"I notice you're feeling frustrated about missing that entry. Fast-paced trading can create intense pressure to catch every move. What physical sensations are you noticing right now? Let's take a moment to reset before your next trade."

### Position Trader + Conservative + Fundamental
"Holding through this volatility while staying true to your analysis takes real emotional discipline. How are you managing the uncertainty while this position is underwater? What helps you maintain conviction in your original thesis?"

### Swing Trader + Moderate + Hybrid
"It sounds like you're weighing both the technical setup and the fundamental story here. What's your process for integrating these different signals? How do you decide which factors get priority in your decision-making?"
