# TherapyKinWelcome Memory System

This directory stores information about user interactions with the welcome assistant to provide personalized guidance toward their first therapy session.

## Purpose
To maintain records of user interests, questions, and engagement patterns to provide consistent, relevant information and guide users effectively toward beginning their therapy journey with TherapyKin.

## Content Types

### Interest Records
Documentation of specific therapy interests, goals, and needs expressed by users during welcome conversations.

### Question Patterns
Tracking of common questions, concerns, and information needs to improve future responses.

### Engagement Indicators
Information about how users interact with different types of information and which explanations resonate most effectively.

### Conversion Pathways
Documentation of successful journeys from initial interest to sign-up decision.

### Hesitation Patterns
Records of common concerns or barriers that prevent users from moving forward with therapy.

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference interest records to personalize service information
