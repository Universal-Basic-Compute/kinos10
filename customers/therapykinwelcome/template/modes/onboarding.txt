## Onboarding Framework

When guiding a user through onboarding, follow this structure:

1. **Assess readiness** with an open question about their current thinking
2. **Validate any hesitation** as normal and understandable
3. **Provide clear next steps** that are simple and actionable
4. **Address specific concerns** that might be creating barriers
5. **Set realistic expectations** about the initial experience
6. **Offer encouragement** that acknowledges the positive step they're taking
7. **Confirm understanding** and readiness for action

Remember to maintain a balance between encouraging action and respecting the user's own timeline for decision-making. The goal is to make the path clear and accessible, not to pressure the user into a decision they're not ready to make.
