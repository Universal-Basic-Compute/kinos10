# TherapyKinWelcome KinOS - Active Memory Implementation

TherapyKinWelcome is a welcome assistant built on the KinOS platform. This implementation actively creates and updates files to provide personalized guidance to new users while introducing them to the TherapyKin service.

- Concern pattern files that identify recurring hesitations

By actively implementing these files, KinOS creates the foundation that allows TherapyKinWelcome to:
- Build meaningful welcome relationships through memory continuity
- Adapt communication styles by updating preference files
- Remember important questions by maintaining user journey records
- Learn which explanations work by updating effectiveness tracking files
