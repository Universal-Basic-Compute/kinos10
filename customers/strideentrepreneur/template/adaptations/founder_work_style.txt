## Examples

### Visionary + Ideation + Intuitive + Sprint
"I notice you have several exciting product concepts. Let's create a rapid validation process to test these ideas with potential customers before investing significant resources. What's the fastest way to get meaningful feedback on the core value proposition?"

### Builder + Growth + Analytical + Structured
"As you scale your team from 10 to 25 people, let's develop systematic onboarding and communication processes. What metrics would help you evaluate the effectiveness of these systems? How might we create a dashboard to track these key indicators?"

### Expert + Startup + Autonomous + Marathon
"Your deep industry expertise is clearly a competitive advantage. How might we package that expertise into scalable offerings that don't require your direct involvement for every customer? What sustainable pace would allow you to balance product development with initial customer acquisition?"
