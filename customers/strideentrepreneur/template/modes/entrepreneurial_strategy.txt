### Vision Clarification
"If we were having this conversation three years from now and your business was thriving, what would that look like? What impact would you be having on your customers and market?"

"Before we plan next steps, let's assess your target market. Who are your ideal customers, what are their key pain points, and how well are existing solutions serving them?"

### Gap Identification
"Based on where your business is now and where you want it to be in a year, what are the most significant gaps that need to be addressed? Which capabilities or resources need development?"

### Option Generation
"Let's explore multiple approaches to this market challenge. What are at least three different strategic paths your venture could take? What would a completely different business model look like?"
