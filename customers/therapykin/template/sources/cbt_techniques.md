# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques

## Core Principles
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is based on the understanding that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. By identifying and changing unhelpful thought patterns, we can influence emotional experiences and behavioral responses.

## Key Techniques

### Cognitive Restructuring
**Purpose**: To identify and challenge distorted or unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more balanced alternatives.

**Process**:
1. Identify automatic thoughts in response to situations
2. Recognize cognitive distortions in these thoughts
3. Challenge distorted thoughts with evidence
4. Develop alternative, more balanced thoughts

**Common Cognitive Distortions**:
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Catastrophizing
- Overgeneralization
- Mental filtering
- Discounting the positive
- Jumping to conclusions
- Emotional reasoning
- Should statements
- Labeling
- Personalization

### Thought Records
**Purpose**: To systematically document and analyze thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

**Components**:
- Situation: What happened?
- Emotions: What feelings arose? (Rate intensity 0-100%)
- Automatic thoughts: What went through your mind? (Rate belief 0-100%)
- Evidence supporting the thought
- Evidence contradicting the thought
- Alternative perspective
- Outcome: Revised emotions and belief ratings

### Behavioral Experiments
**Purpose**: To test the validity of beliefs through real-world experiences.

**Process**:
1. Identify the belief to be tested
2. Design an experiment to test the belief
3. Predict the outcome based on the belief
4. Carry out the experiment
5. Evaluate the results and implications

### Activity Scheduling
**Purpose**: To increase engagement in rewarding activities and combat avoidance.

**Process**:
1. Monitor current activity levels and mood
2. Identify potentially rewarding or mastery activities
3. Schedule specific activities for specific times
4. Rate anticipated pleasure and mastery
5. Carry out activities and rate actual pleasure and mastery
6. Review and adjust schedule based on findings

### Exposure Hierarchies
**Purpose**: To gradually confront feared situations to reduce anxiety.

**Process**:
1. Create a list of feared situations
2. Rank situations from least to most anxiety-provoking (0-100)
3. Begin exposure with lower-anxiety items
4. Practice until anxiety decreases significantly
5. Move to next item on hierarchy
6. Continue until able to manage highest-anxiety situations

### Problem-Solving
**Purpose**: To develop systematic approaches to addressing life challenges.

**Steps**:
1. Define the problem specifically
2. Generate multiple possible solutions
3. Evaluate pros and cons of each solution
4. Select a solution to implement
5. Plan the implementation in detail
6. Carry out the plan
7. Evaluate the outcome

### Relaxation Techniques
**Purpose**: To reduce physical tension and physiological arousal.

**Methods**:
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Deep breathing
- Guided imagery
- Applied relaxation
- Body scan meditation
