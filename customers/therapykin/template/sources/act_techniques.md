# Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Techniques

## Core Principles
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) aims to increase psychological flexibility through six core processes: acceptance, cognitive defusion, present moment awareness, self-as-context, values clarification, and committed action.

## Key Processes and Techniques

### Acceptance
**Purpose**: To cultivate willingness to experience thoughts and feelings without unnecessary attempts to change or control them.

**Techniques**:
1. **Willingness exercises**:
   - "Passengers on the Bus" metaphor
   - "Tug of War with a Monster" metaphor
   - "Unwelcome Party Guest" metaphor

2. **Expansion exercises**:
   - Making room for feelings
   - Breathing into sensations
   - "Physicalizing" emotions (giving them shape, color, texture)

3. **Urge surfing**:
   - Observing urges rise and fall without acting on them
   - Noticing physical sensations associated with urges
   - Describing the experience without judgment

### Cognitive Defusion
**Purpose**: To change one's relationship with thoughts rather than changing thought content.

**Techniques**:
1. **Distancing from thoughts**:
   - "I'm having the thought that..." prefix
   - Thanking the mind for a thought
   - Labeling thoughts as thoughts

2. **Altering thought presentation**:
   - Saying thoughts in a cartoon voice
   - Repeating a word until it loses meaning
   - Writing thoughts on cards and carrying them

3. **Metaphors for thoughts**:
   - "Leaves on a Stream" visualization
   - "Thoughts as Clouds" visualization
   - "Mind as a Radio" metaphor

### Present Moment Awareness
**Purpose**: To flexibly attend to what's happening in the here and now.

**Techniques**:
1. **Mindfulness exercises**:
   - Five senses awareness
   - Mindful breathing
   - Body scan

2. **Attention training**:
   - Noticing three things exercise
   - Counting sounds
   - Following the breath

3. **Flexible attention**:
   - Shifting attention between different sensory channels
   - Zooming in and out of awareness
   - Noticing what's in the foreground vs. background

### Self-as-Context
**Purpose**: To develop a transcendent sense of self that observes experiences without being defined by them.

**Techniques**:
1. **Observer exercises**:
   - "Chessboard" metaphor (you are the board, not the pieces)
   - "Sky and Weather" metaphor
   - Observer perspective meditation

2. **Perspective-taking**:
   - "Looking at vs. Looking from" exercise
   - "Who is aware?" inquiry
   - Timeline visualization (connecting past, present, future self)

3. **Defusion from self-concepts**:
   - "I am" vs. "I am having the thought that I am" exercise
   - Listing self-descriptions and noticing who's doing the describing
   - "Wearing labels lightly" practice

### Values Clarification
**Purpose**: To identify what truly matters to the person and the qualities they want to embody.

**Techniques**:
1. **Values exploration**:
   - "80th Birthday" or "Funeral" exercise
   - Values card sort
   - Life compass assessment

2. **Values vs. goals distinction**:
   - "Skiing" metaphor (values as direction, goals as destinations)
   - Values as chosen life directions
   - Identifying values-consistent actions

3. **Values clarification exercises**:
   - "What do you want your life to stand for?"
   - "If barriers were removed, how would you live?"
   - "What matters most deeply to you?"

### Committed Action
**Purpose**: To develop patterns of effective action linked to chosen values.

**Techniques**:
1. **Goal setting**:
   - SMART goals aligned with values
   - Breaking down goals into small steps
   - Identifying potential obstacles

2. **Behavioral activation**:
   - Scheduling values-based activities
   - Graded task assignments
   - Skills training for valued domains

3. **Commitment strategies**:
   - Public commitments
   - Implementation intentions ("If-then" plans)
   - Building patterns of small actions

## Clinical Applications

- Present moment awareness to counter rumination

### Anxiety
- Acceptance of anxiety sensations without avoidance
- Defusion from catastrophic thinking
- Values-based exposure
- Willingness to experience anxiety in service of values

### Chronic Pain
- Acceptance of pain sensations
- Defusion from pain-related thoughts

- Values clarification (what matters more than temporary relief)
- Committed action toward recovery values

## Therapeutic Relationship in ACT

### Therapeutic Stance
- Therapist as fellow traveler, not expert
- Creative hopelessness before introducing alternatives
- Experiential teaching rather than intellectual explanation
- Willingness to model processes (therapist self-disclosure)

### Common Interventions

- Metaphors and stories
- Paradoxical interventions
- Present-focused awareness in session

### Session Structure
- Check-in with mindfulness
- Review of practice
- Introduction of new concepts experientially
- Linking to values
- Committed action homework

- Chronic pain
- Depression
