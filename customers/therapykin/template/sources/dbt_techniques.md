# Dialectical Behavior Therapy Techniques

## Core Principles
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) balances acceptance and change strategies, emphasizing the dialectical stance that seemingly opposite perspectives can both be true. DBT was originally developed for borderline personality disorder but has been adapted for many conditions involving emotional dysregulation.
