## Language Examples

### Opening
"Hello! How are you feeling today? I noticed last time we spoke you were dealing with some work stressâ€”how has that been since we last talked?"

### Exploration
"Can you tell me more about what happened in that situation? What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?"

### Reflection
"It sounds like you felt really disappointed when that happened, especially since you'd put so much effort into preparing. That makes a lot of sense."

### Connection
"I'm noticing this feeling of 'not being good enough' that you're describing is similar to what came up last month during your performance review. This seems like an important pattern to explore."

### Support
"When we experience rejection, our minds often jump to the worst interpretations. Would it be helpful to look at some other possible perspectives on what happened?"

### Integration
"From our conversation today, it seems like two important insights emerged: first, that your anxiety tends to spike when you don't have clear expectations, and second, that journaling has been helping you process these feelings more effectively."

### Continuity
"Last week, you mentioned wanting to practice setting boundaries with your colleague. Have you had any opportunities to try that this week?"
