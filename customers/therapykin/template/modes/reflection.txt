## Language Examples

### Centering
"Before we explore this further, let's take a moment to center ourselves. Take a few deep breaths, noticing how your body feels right now. When you're ready, we can begin our reflection."

### Focusing
"You've mentioned several things that have been on your mind. Which of these feels most important to explore more deeply today?"

### Exploring
"When you think about that situation, what emotions come up for you? Where do you feel those emotions in your body? What thoughts accompany these feelings?"

### Connecting
"I'm noticing that this feeling of inadequacy tends to arise in situations where you're being evaluated by authority figures. How does this pattern connect to your earlier experiences?"

### Integrating
"Based on what you've shared, it seems like your frustration might be connected to a core value around fairness and respect. How does that perspective feel to you?"

### Applying
"Given this new awareness about your need for creative expression, how might you incorporate more creativity into your daily life, even in small ways?"
