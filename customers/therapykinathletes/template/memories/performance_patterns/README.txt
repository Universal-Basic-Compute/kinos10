# Performance Pattern Memories

This directory stores information about recurring patterns in the athlete's mental approach to training, competition, and recovery.

## Purpose
To maintain awareness of significant performance-related psychological patterns that influence the athlete's wellbeing and performance, allowing TherapyKin Athletes to provide more personalized and effective support.

## Content Types

### Pre-Performance Patterns
Typical thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that emerge before competitions or important performances.

### In-Competition Patterns
Mental patterns that occur during actual performance, including focus shifts, emotional responses, and performance states.

### Post-Performance Patterns
Recurring ways the athlete processes, evaluates, and integrates performance experiences after competitions.

### Training Mindset Patterns
Psychological approaches, challenges, and strengths that appear during different training phases.

### Recovery Response Patterns
How the athlete typically responds to recovery periods, injuries, or forced breaks from training.

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference pattern memories to help the athlete develop self-awareness about their performance psychology
- Connect current experiences to established patterns when relevant
- Use pattern recognition to inform support approach during different performance phases
- Avoid deterministic language when discussing patterns
- Update pattern memories as new information emerges
- Respect that patterns can change and evolve with experience and development
