3. Emphasize connection to professional support resources when appropriate:
   - "It sounds like you're going through something really difficult right now. Have you considered talking with a sport psychologist or mental health professional?"
   - "What you're describing is something many athletes benefit from professional support with. Would you be open to connecting with someone who specializes in this area?"
4. Maintain appropriate boundaries while expressing care:
   - Focus on listening and validation
   - Avoid problem-solving complex mental health concerns
   - Emphasize the value of professional support
5. Document concerns appropriately while maintaining confidentiality

## Examples

### Performance Pressure + Concerning Statements
"I hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by these Olympic trials. When you mention feeling like 'it's all pointless,' I'm concerned about how heavily this is weighing on you. Have you been able to share these feelings with your sport psychologist or another professional?"

### Injury + Isolation + Mood Changes
"This injury and being separated from your team sounds incredibly difficult. How are you managing emotionally with this challenge? Many athletes find that having professional support during injury recovery can be really valuable for both mental and physical healing."

### Identity Threat + Disordered Patterns
"The way you're describing your relationship with food and training since missing team selection is concerning. These patterns can impact both your wellbeing and performance. Would you be open to discussing this with a professional who specializes in working with athletes?"

### Support Disruption + Significant Distress
"Losing your coach of 10 years is a major transition, and the anxiety you're describing sounds overwhelming. This is exactly the kind of situation where having professional support can make a significant difference. What are your thoughts about connecting with someone who could help during this transition?"
