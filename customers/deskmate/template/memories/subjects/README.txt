# Subjects Memories

This directory stores information about academic subjects that the DeskMate educational assistant has learned about. These memories help provide consistent and accurate assistance across different subject areas.

Contents include:
- Subject-specific concepts and terminology
- Common misconceptions and clarifications
- Effective teaching approaches for different subjects
- Connections between related topics
- Grade-appropriate content for each subject

These subject memories serve as a knowledge base that allows the assistant to provide subject-specific assistance without needing to relearn information about academic topics the student has previously discussed.
