# FICTRA Economic Model

## Overview

This document outlines the economic principles, models, and mechanisms that govern the FICTRA dual-token system. The economic design is fundamental to FICTRA's value proposition, creating a stable trading environment while generating additional value for sovereign entities through the innovative token allocation system.

## Economic Foundations

### Dual-Token Value Framework

FICTRA's economic model is built on the complementary relationship between two token types:

1. **Payment Token (PT)**
   - Market-determined value with stability mechanisms
   - Primary utility in commodity transactions
   - Designed to reduce volatility while maintaining market efficiency

2. **Foundation Token (FT)**
   - Formula-based allocation to sovereign entities
   - Value derived from verified commodity exports
   - Creates additional economic benefits for producing nations

### Core Economic Principles

- **Value Creation** - Generate new value beyond traditional commodity trading
- **Stability** - Reduce volatility without sacrificing market efficiency
- **Sovereignty** - Enhance economic independence for participating nations
- **Efficiency** - Minimize transaction costs and settlement times
- **Sustainability** - Ensure long-term economic viability of the system

- Market maker incentives

## Economic Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive economic monitoring:

- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Economic health indicators
- Early warning systems for potential instability
- Comparative analysis against traditional systems

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Update economic models based on system performance data
- Regularly review and calibrate model parameters
- Document all changes to economic mechanisms
- Ensure consistency between economic models and implementation
