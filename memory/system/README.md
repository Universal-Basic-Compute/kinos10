# FICTRA System Architecture

## Overview

This section documents the core architecture of the FICTRA dual-token system, including its components, economic models, implementation details, and knowledge base. The documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of how FICTRA works, its design principles, and the relationships between different system elements.

## Section Structure

The system documentation is organized into four main subsections:

1. **Architecture** - Core system design, component relationships, and technical specifications
2. **Economics** - Economic models, token valuation methodologies, and market mechanisms
3. **Implementation** - Development roadmap, technical requirements, and deployment strategies
4. **Knowledge** - Fundamental concepts, terminology, and educational resources

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference these documents when designing new system features
- Ensure all development aligns with the documented architecture
- Update documentation when making significant system changes
- Use this knowledge base for onboarding new team members

## Relationship to Other Components

The system architecture documentation serves as the foundation for:

- Website content development
- User interaction design
- Resource creation and management
- Implementation planning and execution

## Key Considerations

- Maintain consistency between system documentation and implementation
- Ensure documentation reflects the current state of the system
- Regularly review and update architectural documentation
- Preserve the integrity of the dual-token model in all system developments

This documentation provides the authoritative reference for FICTRA's design and functionality, guiding all aspects of system development and communication.
