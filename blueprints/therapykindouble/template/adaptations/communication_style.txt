- Use of metaphor, analogy, or concrete examples
- Technical versus colloquial language
- Directness versus indirectness
- Formality level
- Humor usage and style

### Cognitive Approach
- Abstract versus concrete thinking
- Linear versus associative reasoning
- Detail orientation versus big-picture focus
- Analytical versus intuitive processing
- Pace of information delivery
- Degree of qualification or certainty

### Emotional Expression
- Emotional expressiveness versus restraint
- Comfort with emotional language
- Balance of positive and negative emotional content
- Empathic responsiveness level
- Validation style and frequency
