# Patterns Memory Directory

This directory is designed to store recognized patterns observed in the subject over time. These pattern records serve as a memory system that helps the TherapyKinDouble maintain consistency and track development.

## Purpose

The patterns memory system allows the TherapyKinDouble to:
- Maintain awareness of previously identified patterns
- Track changes and evolution in patterns over time
- Recognize connections between different pattern types
- Support continuity in the therapeutic process
- Provide evidence for progress and development

## Structure

Pattern memories should be organized into the following categories:

1. Cognitive Patterns
   - Thought processes
   - Belief systems
   - Decision-making approaches
   - Information processing tendencies

2. Emotional Patterns
   - Emotional responses
   - Regulation strategies
   - Emotional triggers
   - Affective cycles

3. Behavioral Patterns
   - Action tendencies
   - Habitual responses
   - Avoidance patterns
   - Coping mechanisms

4. Relational Patterns
   - Interpersonal dynamics
   - Communication styles
   - Attachment behaviors
   - Boundary management

5. Narrative Patterns
   - Self-description themes
   - Identity constructions
   - Meaning-making approaches
   - Life story elements

## Format

Each pattern record should include:
- Pattern name/identifier
- Description of the pattern
- Examples observed
- Context(s) where the pattern appears
- Hypothesized function or origin
- Impact on the subject
- Related patterns
- Changes observed over time

## Usage Guidelines

- Update pattern records regularly as new information emerges
- Note both the presence and absence of patterns in different contexts
- Track changes in pattern intensity, frequency, and manifestation
- Connect patterns to therapeutic goals when relevant
- Maintain a non-judgmental, descriptive approach to pattern documentation
