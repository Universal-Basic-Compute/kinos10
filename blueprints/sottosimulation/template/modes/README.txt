# SOTTOSIMULATION MODES

This directory contains the mode definitions for the simulation system:

- simulation_standard.txt  - Normal restaurant operation
- simulation_rush.txt     - High intensity service periods
- simulation_urgence.txt  - Emergency situations
- simulation_formation.txt - Training scenarios
- simulation_debug.txt    - Testing and validation
- simulation_analysis.txt - Performance analysis
- simulation_calibration.txt - System calibration

Each mode file defines:
- Characteristics of the mode
- Generated events
- Simulated behaviors
- Transition mechanisms to other modes
