# SOTTOSIMULATION DATA DIRECTORY

This directory contains all data files used by the simulation system:

/analysis/      - Performance metrics and analysis data
/events/        - Event definitions for different simulation modes
/message_templates/ - Templates for generated messages
/simulation_profiles/ - Staff and client behavior profiles
/generation_rules/ - Rules for generating behaviors and events

Each subdirectory contains specific configuration files that define how
the simulation behaves in different scenarios and modes.
