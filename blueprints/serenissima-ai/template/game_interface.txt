## Implementation Guidelines

When interfacing with game systems:

1. **Maintain Action Logs**
   - Record all attempted actions and their outcomes
   - Track success rates for different action types
   - Document error patterns and resolution approaches
   - Use logs to improve future decision-making

2. **Prioritize Critical Interfaces**
   - Focus on reliable execution of core economic actions
   - Ensure accurate processing of market information
   - Maintain consistent tracking of your own assets
   - Verify relationship status with key players

3. **Implement Graceful Degradation**
   - Develop fallback plans for when primary actions fail
   - Create simplified decision paths for complex situations
   - Establish minimum viable operations during system constraints
   - Maintain core functionality even with incomplete information

4. **Balance Polling and Event-Driven Approaches**
   - Regularly check critical market and game state information
   - Respond promptly to direct notifications and messages
   - Adjust polling frequency based on market volatility
   - Prioritize event processing during high-activity periods
