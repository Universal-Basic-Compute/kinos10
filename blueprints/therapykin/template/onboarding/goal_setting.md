# Therapeutic Goal Setting Framework

This framework guides the collaborative process of establishing meaningful, effective therapeutic goals with users.

## Purpose
To create clear, personalized goals that provide direction for therapy, motivate engagement, and allow for measurable progress tracking.

## Goal Setting Process

### 1. Exploration Phase
- Discuss hopes and expectations for therapy
- Identify areas of dissatisfaction or desired change
- Explore values that could inform meaningful goals
- Consider previous attempts at change
- Understand barriers and supports for goal achievement

### 2. Clarification Phase
- Transform vague desires into specific goals
- Prioritize goals based on importance and readiness
- Distinguish between process goals and outcome goals
- Identify short-term and long-term goals
- Connect goals to deeper values and meaning

### 3. Refinement Phase
- Ensure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Break larger goals into smaller, manageable steps
- Anticipate potential obstacles
- Identify resources needed for success
- Create a timeline for goal progression

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Develop specific action plans for each goal
- Establish tracking methods
- Schedule regular goal review sessions
- Create accountability structures
- Celebrate progress and small wins

### 5. Revision Phase
- Periodically review and update goals
- Adjust based on progress and changing circumstances
- Refine strategies based on what's working
- Add new goals as appropriate
- Acknowledge and integrate learning from setbacks

## SMART Goal Framework

- Within the user's control and influence
- Considers available resources and constraints
- Example: "Call one friend per week" vs. "Have a perfect social life"

### Relevant
- Aligned with broader therapeutic aims
- Meaningful and important to the user
- Connected to values and long-term wellbeing
- Example: "Practice one self-compassion exercise daily" vs. "Be perfect at self-care"

### Time-bound
- Has a clear timeframe or deadline
- Includes milestones for longer-term goals
- Creates appropriate urgency and focus
- Example: "Reduce avoidance of driving by taking three 10-minute drives this week" vs. "Drive more"

## Goal Documentation Template

For each therapeutic goal, document:

1. **Goal Statement**: Clear, SMART description of the goal
2. **Value Connection**: How this goal connects to user's values
3. **Current Baseline**: Present status or starting point
4. **Success Indicators**: How progress will be measured
5. **Action Steps**: Specific actions to take toward the goal
6. **Potential Obstacles**: Anticipated challenges
7. **Support Resources**: Tools, people, or strategies that will help
8. **Timeline**: Target dates for milestones and completion
9. **Review Schedule**: When progress will be assessed

## Common Goal Setting Challenges

### Overly Ambitious Goals
- Signs: Multiple large goals, unrealistic timeframes
- Response: Break into smaller steps, prioritize, extend timelines
- Example Reframe: "Work on one aspect of social anxiety each month" vs. "Overcome all anxiety"

### Vague or Unmeasurable Goals
- Signs: Cannot clearly determine if progress is made
- Response: Add specific metrics, behaviors, or experiences
- Example Reframe: "Practice assertiveness in two situations weekly" vs. "Be more assertive"

### Externally-Focused Goals
- Signs: Goals depend on others' behaviors or responses
- Response: Refocus on user's own behaviors, responses, and boundaries
- Example Reframe: "Communicate my needs clearly" vs. "Make my partner understand me"

### Avoidance-Based Goals
- Signs: Goals focused on avoiding discomfort rather than growth
- Response: Reframe toward approach goals and valued living
- Example Reframe: "Engage in meaningful activities despite anxiety" vs. "Avoid feeling anxious"

### Disconnected Goals
- Signs: Goals not connected to deeper values or meaningful change
- Response: Explore the "why" behind goals, connect to values
- Example Reframe: "Connect daily with my value of creativity through 15 minutes of writing" vs. "Write more"

## Implementation Guidelines

- Revisit goals at regular intervals (every 4-6 sessions)
- Document progress and adjustments
- Celebrate small wins and progress
- Use setbacks as learning opportunities
- Maintain flexibility while preserving accountability
- Balance structure with responsiveness to emerging needs
- Ensure goals evolve as the user grows and changes

Remember that the goal-setting process itself is therapeutic and provides valuable information about the user's values, expectations, and approach to change.
