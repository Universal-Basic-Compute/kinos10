# Mindfulness Practices

## Core Principles
Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment with curiosity, openness, and acceptance. It cultivates awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and environment without judgment or reactivity.

## Foundational Practices

### Mindful Breathing
**Purpose**: To anchor attention in the present through awareness of the breath.

**Practice**:
1. Find a comfortable position
2. Bring attention to the natural rhythm of breathing
3. Notice sensations of breath in the body (nose, chest, abdomen)
4. When mind wanders, gently return attention to breath
5. Continue for a set period (starting with 3-5 minutes)

**Variations**:
- Counting breaths (1-10, then restart)
- Using phrases ("breathing in calm, breathing out tension")
- Following the complete cycle of each breath
- Breathing with hand on abdomen to feel movement

### Body Scan
**Purpose**: To develop awareness of physical sensations throughout the body.

**Practice**:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably
2. Bring attention to feet, noticing sensations
3. Slowly move attention upward through the body
4. Notice sensations in each area without trying to change them
5. If no sensation is present, simply note that
6. Continue until reaching the top of the head

**Variations**:
- Brief scan (3-5 minutes) vs. extended scan (30-45 minutes)
- Scanning from head to toe
- Adding gentle movement after scanning each area
- Noticing areas of tension and consciously releasing

**Practice**:
1. Walk slowly and deliberately
2. Notice sensations in feet as they contact the ground
3. Feel weight shifting, balance, and movement
4. Expand awareness to whole body moving through space
5. When mind wanders, return to sensation of walking

### Sitting Meditation
**Purpose**: To develop sustained attention and awareness.

**Practice**:
1. Sit with stable, comfortable posture
2. Establish attention on anchor (breath, body, sounds)
3. Notice when mind wanders
4. Gently return attention to anchor
5. Continue for set period (building from 5-30+ minutes)

**Variations**:
- Open monitoring (awareness of whatever arises)
- Focused attention (maintaining focus on specific anchor)
- Loving-kindness meditation
