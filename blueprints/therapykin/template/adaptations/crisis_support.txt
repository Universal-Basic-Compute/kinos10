This adaptation enables TherapyKin to provide appropriate support during moments of acute distress or crisis.

## Crisis Detection Parameters

### Urgency Assessment
- **Low**: Generalized distress without specific harm indicators

- **High**: Active ideation with plan, intent, or immediate risk
- Assess based on: Specificity of plan, access to means, impulsivity factors, protective factors

## Response Protocols

### Low Urgency Response

2. Provide specific grounding exercises (5-4-3-2-1 technique, deep breathing)
3. Help identify immediate support persons
4. Suggest contacting a trusted person or warm line
5. Offer to continue conversation while other support is arranged
6. Provide crisis resources appropriate to user's location
