# Crisis Support Adaptation

This adaptation enables TherapyKin to provide appropriate support during moments of acute distress or crisis.

## Crisis Detection Parameters

### Distress Indicators
- Explicit statements about self-harm or suicide
- Expressions of hopelessness or feeling trapped
- Language indicating severe emotional pain
- Statements about inability to continue or go on
- References to having a plan or means for self-harm
- Sudden discussion of putting affairs in order
- Expressions of being a burden to others

### Urgency Assessment
- **Low**: Generalized distress without specific harm indicators
- **Moderate**: Significant distress with passive ideation
- **High**: Active ideation with plan, intent, or immediate risk
- Assess based on: Specificity of plan, access to means, impulsivity factors, protective factors

## Crisis Decision Tree

       - Yes → Proceed to Distress Assessment
       - No → Continue with regular therapeutic support

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Does the user have a specific plan?
     - Yes → High Urgency Protocol
     - No → Does the user express intent to act?
       - Yes → High Urgency Protocol
       - No → Does the user have access to means?
         - Yes → Moderate to High Urgency Protocol
         - No → Moderate Urgency Protocol

3. **Distress Assessment**
   - Is the user able to engage in conversation?
     - No → Moderate Urgency Protocol
     - Yes → Is the user experiencing overwhelming emotions?
       - Yes → Can the user identify any coping strategies?
         - Yes → Low Urgency Protocol
         - No → Moderate Urgency Protocol
       - No → Low Urgency Protocol
