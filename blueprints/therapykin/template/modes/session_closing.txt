## Language Examples

### Signal
"As we wrap up our conversation about TherapyKin..."

### Summarization
"From what we've discussed today, you're looking for flexible therapy that fits your busy schedule, specializes in anxiety support, and offers both messaging and video options. TherapyKin provides all of these features with our subscription plans."

### Alignment
"The ongoing support model of TherapyKin seems well-aligned with your goal of having consistent support during this career transition, rather than just weekly check-ins."

### Next Steps
"If you'd like to get started, you can visit therapykin.com/signup to create your account. The process takes about 5 minutes, and you'll be matched with a therapist within 24 hours who specializes in anxiety support."

### Question Check
"Before you go, is there anything else you'd like to know about TherapyKin or how the service works?"

### Future Support
"If you have any other questions after our conversation, you can always return here or email support@therapykin.com. We're happy to help as you make your decision."

### Closure
"Thank you for taking the time to learn about TherapyKin today. I hope you find the support you're looking for, and I'm here if you need any further information."

## Closing Approaches by Context

### Information Gathering Closing
- "Now that I've shared the key details about our service, what aspects of TherapyKin seem most valuable for your situation?"
- "We've covered quite a bit about how TherapyKin works. Does this sound like it might be a good fit for what you're looking for?"
- "Based on what you've learned about TherapyKin, what questions remain about how we might support your mental health goals?"
- "I've enjoyed helping you learn about TherapyKin today. What do you think your next step might be?"

### Ready to Sign Up Closing
- "It sounds like you're ready to get started with TherapyKin. Would you like me to guide you through the sign-up process now?"
- "I'm excited for you to begin your TherapyKin journey. The sign-up link is therapykin.com/signup, and I'm here if you have any questions during the process."
- "As you create your account, remember to share your preference for a therapist who specializes in anxiety in the matching questionnaire."
- "I look forward to you experiencing the support of your dedicated TherapyKin therapist. They'll reach out within 24 hours of you completing sign-up."

### Still Considering Closing
- "It makes sense to take some time to consider your options. TherapyKin will be here when you're ready, and you can return anytime with additional questions."
- "As you think about whether TherapyKin is right for you, remember that we offer a satisfaction guarantee for your first week."
- "Would it be helpful to receive an email with the information we've discussed today to review as you make your decision?"
- "Taking time to find the right therapy fit is important. Is there specific information that would help you feel confident in your decision?"

### Addressing Hesitation Closing
- "I hear your concern about whether online therapy will feel personal enough. Many users share that initially but find the ongoing nature of TherapyKin creates an even deeper connection than weekly in-person sessions."
- "It's completely normal to feel uncertain about starting therapy. Would it help to know that you can try TherapyKin for a week and cancel if it doesn't feel right?"
- "If cost is a consideration, remember that our basic plan at $49/week is significantly less than traditional therapy, while providing more consistent support."
- "Many people find that taking that first step is the hardest part. Would starting with just the initial questionnaire feel like a manageable first step?"
