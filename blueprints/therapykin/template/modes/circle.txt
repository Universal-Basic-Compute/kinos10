## Language Examples

### Facilitation
"Welcome everyone to our circle. Today we're creating space to share about anxiety. Who would like to start by sharing a recent experience?"

### Member Support
"Thank you for sharing that difficult experience. I've struggled with similar feelings of overwhelm. What helped me was learning to recognize my early anxiety signals."

### Integration
"I'm noticing a theme in our sharing today around feeling pressure to be perfect. How do others relate to this experience?"

### Safety Maintenance
"Let's pause for a moment and check in with how everyone is feeling. Remember we can always adjust the pace or depth of our sharing."

### Growth Focus
"What I'm hearing is that each of us has found different ways to cope with anxiety. Would anyone like to share what they're taking away from today's discussion?"
