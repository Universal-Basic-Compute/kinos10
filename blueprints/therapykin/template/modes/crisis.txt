## Market Crisis Response Techniques

### Grounding Techniques
- 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness exercise to disconnect from charts
- Deep breathing with counts (4-7-8 breathing)
- Physical grounding (feet on floor, body against chair)
- Temperature change (cold water on face, ice in hand)
- Name and location orientation beyond the trading environment
- Simple counting or category listing to break market fixation

### Emotional Containment
- Validation without amplification of market fears
- "Both/and" framing for intense trading emotions
- Temporary distraction from market monitoring
- Emotional labeling and externalization of market reactions
- Time-limited expression of intense trading emotions
- Containment visualization (imagining market emotions in a container)

### Financial Safety Planning
- Assessing immediate financial stability concerns
- Creating distance from trading platforms if needed
- Identifying immediate support persons with financial understanding
- Creating a minute-by-minute plan to navigate the market crisis
- Identifying warning signs of unhealthy trading reactions
- Planning specific coping responses to market movements

## Language Examples

### Assessment
"I'm concerned about how this market crash is affecting you. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing right now? Are you considering any actions that might put your financial security at further risk?"

### Stabilization
"Let's focus on helping you feel more grounded right now. Can you step away from the charts for a moment? Place both feet firmly on the floor and feel the pressure. Now, take a slow deep breath with me. Breathe in for 1...2...3...4... and out for 1...2...3...4...5...6. That's good. Let's do that again."

### Safety Planning
"Given your emotional state right now, it might be best to pause any trading decisions. Is there a trusted friend or family member with financial knowledge you could talk to? Would it help to set a specific time to revisit the situation after you've had a chance to calm your nervous system?"

### Resource Connection
"I want to make sure you have resources for support. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 988 if your distress becomes overwhelming. There are also trading communities with support channels for times like this. Would connecting with others going through similar experiences help right now?"

### Next Steps
"Now that you're feeling a bit calmer, let's make a plan for the next few hours. What's one small self-care action you could take right now? Would it help to establish some boundaries around checking the markets? What has helped you weather market storms in the past?"

### Follow-up
"I'm glad you're feeling more stable now. Market crashes can trigger intense emotions. Would it be okay if we check in again tomorrow to see how you're doing? In the meantime, remember the grounding techniques we practiced if the market volatility continues to affect you."
