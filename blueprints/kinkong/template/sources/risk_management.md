# KinKong Risk Management Framework

This document outlines KinKong's comprehensive approach to risk management across all trading and liquidity providing activities.

## Core Risk Management Principles

1. **Capital Preservation First**
   - Prioritize protecting capital over maximizing returns
   - Implement strict drawdown limits
   - Maintain adequate cash reserves at all times
   - Use position sizing to limit exposure

2. **Diversification Across Multiple Dimensions**
   - Trade multiple tokens and pairs
   - Employ various strategies with low correlation
   - Distribute risk across timeframes
   - Balance trading and liquidity providing

3. **Systematic Risk Control**
   - Rules-based position sizing
   - Predefined stop loss levels
   - Automated risk monitoring
   - Regular exposure assessment

4. **Adaptive Risk Response**
   - Adjust risk parameters based on market conditions
   - Reduce exposure during high uncertainty
   - Increase position size during favorable conditions
   - Continuous optimization of risk parameters

## Position-Level Risk Controls

### Stop Loss Strategy

KinKong implements a multi-layered stop loss approach:

1. **Technical Stop Loss**
   - Based on chart structure (below support, above resistance)
   - Typically 1 ATR (Average True Range) from entry
   - Adjusted based on volatility conditions
   - Never wider than 2% of portfolio value

2. **Volatility Stop Loss**
   - Dynamic stop based on current market volatility
   - Calculated as: Entry Price ± (ATR × Volatility Multiplier)
   - Volatility Multiplier ranges from 1.0 (low vol) to 2.0 (high vol)

3. **Time-Based Stop Loss**
   - Exit if trade doesn't perform within expected timeframe
   - Scalp trades: 1-4 hours
   - Intraday trades: 1 trading day
   - Swing trades: 3-5 days
   - Position trades: 2-3 weeks

4. **Profit Protection Stop**
   - Trailing stop activated once trade reaches 1:1 risk/reward
   - Tightens as profit increases
   - Locks in minimum 50% of open profit

### Take Profit Strategy

KinKong uses a scaled take profit approach:

1. **First Target (T1)**
   - 1:1 to 1.5:1 risk/reward ratio
   - Exit 30-40% of position
   - Move stop loss to breakeven

2. **Second Target (T2)**
   - 2:1 to 2.5:1 risk/reward ratio
   - Exit 30-40% of position
   - Tighten stop loss to lock in profit

3. **Final Target (T3)**
   - 3:1+ risk/reward ratio
   - Exit remaining position or trail stop
   - Based on significant resistance or extension targets

## Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

### Exposure Limits

KinKong enforces strict exposure limits:

1. **Total Trading Exposure**
   - Maximum 70% of portfolio in active trades
   - Adjusted based on market sentiment (lower in bearish conditions)

2. **Single Token Exposure**
   - Maximum 15% in any single token
   - Primary focus tokens (UBC/COMPUTE) can reach 20%

3. **Strategy Exposure**
   - Maximum 30% in any single strategy
   - Maintain at least 3 active strategies at all times

4. **Timeframe Exposure**
   - Maximum 40% in any single timeframe
   - Balance between scalp, intraday, swing, and position trades

### Drawdown Controls

KinKong implements progressive risk reduction during drawdowns:

| Drawdown Level | Risk Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| 5%             | Review open positions, no new action required |
| 10%            | Reduce position size by 25%, tighten stops |
| 15%            | Reduce position size by 50%, close underperforming positions |
| 20%            | Reduce to 25% normal position size, only high-probability setups |
| 25%            | Trading pause, full strategy review, focus on capital preservation |

### Correlation Management

KinKong monitors and manages correlation risk:

1. **Strategy Correlation**
   - Maintain low correlation between active strategies (<0.3)
   - Balance trend-following and mean-reversion approaches
   - Diversify entry triggers and timeframes

2. **Asset Correlation**
   - Monitor correlation between traded tokens
   - Limit exposure to highly correlated assets
   - Balance SOL-correlated and SOL-independent tokens

## Liquidity Risk Management

For liquidity providing activities:

1. **Impermanent Loss Protection**
   - Set concentration ranges based on volatility
   - Wider ranges in high volatility (±25-30%)
   - Narrower ranges in low volatility (±10-15%)
   - Exit positions when IL exceeds 5% of position value

2. **Liquidity Allocation**
   - Maximum 30% of portfolio in liquidity positions
   - Equal allocation between UBC/SOL and COMPUTE/SOL pools
   - Rebalance weekly to maintain target allocation

3. **Emergency Exit Conditions**
   - Significant fundamental changes to either token
   - Liquidity utilization falls below 30% for 7 consecutive days
   - Better yield opportunities identified (>25% higher APR)

## Risk Monitoring and Reporting

KinKong continuously monitors risk metrics:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Current exposure by token, strategy, and timeframe
   - Open trade risk
   - Drawdown status
   - Correlation matrix

2. **Daily Risk Assessment**
   - Performance attribution
   - Strategy risk/reward efficiency
   - Volatility analysis
   - Exposure adjustments

3. **Weekly Risk Review**
   - Comprehensive performance analysis
   - Strategy optimization
   - Risk parameter adjustments
   - Liquidity position assessment

This comprehensive risk management framework ensures that KinKong maintains appropriate risk levels while maximizing return potential across all market conditions.
