# Music Theory Reference

This document provides a reference for music theory concepts relevant to BeatsFoundry's compositional approach.

## Harmonic Concepts

### Scales and Modes
- **Major Scale**: The standard Western scale (W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern)
- **Natural Minor**: The Aeolian mode (W-H-W-W-H-W-W pattern)
- **Harmonic Minor**: Natural minor with raised 7th degree
- **Melodic Minor**: Natural minor with raised 6th and 7th ascending, natural descending
- **Modes**: Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor), Locrian
- **Pentatonic Scales**: Five-note scales (major pentatonic, minor pentatonic)
- **Blues Scale**: Minor pentatonic with added â™­5 (blue note)
- **Non-Western Scales**: Various scales from different cultural traditions

### Chord Construction
- **Triads**: Three-note chords (major, minor, diminished, augmented)
- **Seventh Chords**: Four-note chords adding a 7th (maj7, min7, dom7, half-dim7, dim7)
- **Extended Chords**: Chords with added 9ths, 11ths, 13ths
- **Altered Chords**: Chords with altered 5ths or 9ths
- **Suspended Chords**: Chords with suspended 2nds or 4ths
- **Inversions**: Changing the bass note of a chord
- **Slash Chords**: Chords with a non-chord tone in the bass

### Harmonic Progressions
- **Diatonic Progressions**: Progressions using chords from a single key
- **Common Cadences**: Authentic, plagal, deceptive, half cadences
- **Modal Interchange**: Borrowing chords from parallel modes
- **Secondary Dominants**: Dominants of non-tonic chords
- **Modulation**: Changing from one key to another
- **Circle of Fifths**: Relationship between keys moving in perfect 5ths
- **Chromatic Mediants**: Chords whose roots are a third apart

## Rhythmic Concepts

### Meter and Time Signatures
- **Simple Meters**: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 (beats divide into 2)
- **Compound Meters**: 6/8, 9/8, 12/8 (beats divide into 3)
- **Odd Meters**: 5/4, 7/8, 11/8, etc.
- **Mixed Meters**: Changing time signatures
- **Polymeters**: Simultaneous different meters

### Rhythmic Techniques
- **Syncopation**: Accenting off-beats
- **Swing**: Uneven division of the beat
- **Polyrhythms**: Simultaneous different rhythmic patterns (3:2, 4:3, etc.)
- **Hemiola**: Three beats in the space of two or vice versa
- **Metric Modulation**: Changing tempo based on rhythmic relationship
- **Additive Rhythm**: Grouping beats asymmetrically (2+3+2 instead of 7)
- **Displacement**: Shifting a pattern earlier or later than expected

## Compositional Techniques

### Form and Structure
- **Phrase Structure**: Antecedent and consequent phrases
- **Common Forms**: Binary, ternary, rondo, sonata, theme and variations
- **Electronic Music Forms**: Intro, build, drop, breakdown, outro
- **Through-Composition**: Continuous development without repetition
- **Cyclic Form**: Material returns throughout a multi-section work

### Melodic Techniques
- **Motif Development**: Transformation of a short musical idea
- **Sequence**: Repetition of a pattern at different pitch levels
- **Inversion**: Turning a melody upside down
- **Retrograde**: Playing a melody backwards
- **Augmentation/Diminution**: Lengthening/shortening note values
- **Counterpoint**: Combining independent melodic lines

### Textural Approaches
- **Monophony**: Single melodic line
- **Homophony**: Melody with accompaniment
- **Polyphony**: Multiple independent melodic lines
- **Heterophony**: Simultaneous variations of the same melody
- **Layering**: Building textures through multiple layers
- **Density Variation**: Changing the number of active elements

## Electronic Music Concepts

### Harmonic Approaches in Electronic Music
- **Drone-Based Harmony**: Extended tones creating harmonic foundation
- **Spectral Harmony**: Harmony derived from overtone series
- **Ambiguous Tonality**: Deliberately unclear tonal centers
- **Quartal/Quintal Harmony**: Chords built on 4ths or 5ths
- **Cluster Harmony**: Closely spaced notes creating tension

### Rhythmic Approaches in Electronic Music
- **Grid-Based Rhythm**: Strict adherence to quantized timing
- **Micro-Timing**: Subtle timing variations for groove
- **Generative Rhythm**: Algorithmically created patterns
- **Euclidean Rhythms**: Evenly distributing beats in a pattern
- **Polymetric Layering**: Different meters occurring simultaneously

### Sound Design as Composition
- **Timbre Modulation**: Changing sound character over time
- **Spectral Composition**: Organizing music based on frequency content
- **Granular Techniques**: Breaking sound into tiny grains for manipulation
- **Morphing**: Gradual transformation between different sounds
- **Textural Evolution**: Developing a piece through textural changes

## Application Guidelines

When applying music theory concepts:
- Consider theory as a tool for expression, not a set of rules
- Balance theoretical complexity with emotional impact
- Use theory to solve specific compositional challenges
- Experiment with combining different theoretical approaches
- Document successful applications for future reference
- Develop your own theoretical framework based on your artistic voice

Music theory should serve your artistic expression rather than constrain it, providing tools and vocabulary to realize your creative vision more effectively.
