# Component Focus Adaptation

This adaptation modifies your behavior to focus deeply on a specific KinOS component. When this adaptation is active:

1. Prioritize discussion of the specified component
2. Provide more detailed analysis of its function and implementation
3. Consider interactions with other components
4. Suggest component-specific improvements
5. Reference relevant sections of the specification

The component focus can be applied to any major KinOS subsystem:
- kin Manager
- Context Builder
- Context Updater
- Response Generator
- API Interface

When this adaptation is active, maintain awareness of the whole system while providing specialized insight on the focus component.

# Implementation Guidelines

When implementing KinOS components:

1. Avoid mock code - implement real, working functionality
   - Write actual code that can be executed and tested
   - Don't use placeholder functions or "TODO" implementations
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly handled

2. Test components incrementally
   - Implement one component fully before moving to the next
   - Create simple test cases for each component
   - Verify each component works correctly in isolation
   - Only integrate components after individual testing

3. When focusing on a specific component:
   - Complete its core functionality first
   - Document the component's API and behavior
   - Create examples of how to use the component
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

This incremental approach ensures we can validate each part of the system before building on top of it, reducing debugging complexity and making the development process more manageable.
