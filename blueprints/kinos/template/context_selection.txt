# Context Selection Guidelines

This document provides detailed guidelines for selecting which files to include in the context window based on different scenarios and requirements.

## Core Principles

1. **Relevance**: Include files most relevant to the current conversation topic
2. **Recency**: Prioritize recently created or updated files
3. **Efficiency**: Optimize token usage by selecting high-value content
4. **Completeness**: Ensure all necessary information is available
5. **Coherence**: Select files that work together to provide a unified context

## Always-Include Files

These files should always be included in the context window:

1. **System Files**:
   - kinos.txt
   - system.txt
   - persona.txt (if present)
   - Current active mode file

2. **Conversation History**:
   - Last 3-5 messages from the conversation
   - Any messages explicitly referenced in the current message

## Scenario-Based Selection

### Information Retrieval Queries

When the user is asking for information:

1. Include knowledge files related to the query topic
2. Include source files with authoritative information
3. Include memory files that record previous explanations on the topic
4. Include adaptation files that modify explanation style

Example query: "How does the Context Builder work?"
Files to include:
- Core system files
- knowledge/context_builder.txt
- memories/architecture/context_builder_design.txt
- sources/specification.txt (sections on Context Builder)
- adaptations/explanation_style.txt (if present)

### Personal Preference Queries

When the user is asking about or expressing preferences:

1. Include memory files related to user preferences
2. Include adaptation files that personalize responses
3. Include knowledge files about preference categories
4. Include recent conversation history for context

Example query: "Remember I prefer technical explanations"
Files to include:
- Core system files
- memories/user_preferences.txt
- adaptations/communication_style.txt
- knowledge/explanation_styles.txt

### Task Execution Requests

When the user is asking the system to perform a task:

1. Include knowledge files related to the task domain
2. Include memory files with previous similar tasks
3. Include adaptation files relevant to task execution
4. Include files with examples or templates

Example query: "Help me design a new component for file versioning"
Files to include:
- Core system files
- knowledge/component_design.txt
- knowledge/file_versioning.txt
- memories/architecture/component_patterns.txt
- examples/component_templates.txt

### System Modification Requests

When the user is asking to modify the system itself:

1. Include files related to the component being modified
2. Include architecture files showing component relationships
3. Include specification files with requirements
4. Include implementation files with current approach

Example query: "Let's improve the Context Updater component"
Files to include:
- Core system files
- knowledge/context_updater.txt
- memories/architecture/context_updater_design.txt
- sources/specification.txt (sections on Context Updater)
- memories/implementation/context_updater_implementation.txt

## Token Budget Management

When selecting files, consider the token budget:

1. **Prioritization Tiers**:
   - Tier 1: Core system files and current conversation (non-negotiable)
   - Tier 2: Files directly relevant to the current query (high priority)
   - Tier 3: Supporting files that provide helpful context (medium priority)
   - Tier 4: Background information for completeness (low priority)

2. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Include full content of Tier 1 and 2 files
   - Include relevant sections of Tier 3 files
   - Summarize or omit Tier 4 files if token budget is tight
   - Prefer smaller, focused files over large, general ones
   - Consider file recency when making trade-offs

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Start with a baseline selection of files
   - Estimate token usage and adjust if necessary
   - If token budget allows, include additional helpful files
   - If token budget is exceeded, remove lower-priority files

## Implementation Techniques

1. **Semantic Matching**:
   - Use semantic similarity between the query and file content
   - Calculate relevance scores for available files
   - Rank files by relevance score

2. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Extract keywords from the user's query
   - Match keywords against file content and metadata
   - Prioritize files with multiple keyword matches

3. **Conversation Analysis**:
   - Identify the conversation topic and intent
   - Select files relevant to the current topic
   - Include files related to recent topic shifts

4. **User Context Awareness**:
   - Consider the user's expertise level
   - Include files relevant to the user's known interests
   - Adapt selection based on user's interaction history

## Continuous Improvement

To improve context selection over time:

1. Monitor which files contribute to successful responses
2. Track when context window limitations affect response quality
3. Analyze patterns in file relevance across different query types
4. Refine selection algorithms based on performance data
5. Regularly review and update these guidelines based on experience
