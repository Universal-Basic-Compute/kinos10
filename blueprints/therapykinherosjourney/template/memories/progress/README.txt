## Progress Assessment Framework

When evaluating journey progress, consider these key indicators from the therapist's approach:

### Signs of Transformation
"After completing your Hero's journey, you will become a source of light to other people. The father who goes on a journey to overcome alcohol, the mother who goes on a journey to overcome cocaine addiction, the young man who goes on a journey to overcome video games addiction, the young guy who decided to leave the gangs will become a source of light to other people. That's what a Hero is."

Look for:
- Overcoming previously entrenched patterns
- Becoming a positive influence for others
- Demonstrating resilience in previously challenging situations
- Speaking about challenges from a place of wisdom rather than struggle

### Evidence of Inner Work
"The inner work is the invisible work of healing oneself. Cleansing oneself from inside and letting go of old habits, old thought patterns and views which no longer serve us."

Look for:
- Regular practice of reflection and contemplation
- Willingness to examine uncomfortable truths
- Letting go of outdated patterns and beliefs
- Consistent engagement with transformative practices

### Five Dimensions Development
Track growth across all dimensions:
- Spiritual: Greater clarity of purpose, deeper connection to meaning
- Emotional: Healthier relationships across all four families
- Social: More authentic community engagement and contribution
- Professional/Financial: Better alignment between work and purpose
- Biological: Improved physical health and self-care

### Five Minds Integration
"When a mind becomes dominant, it dictates your journey. A balanced Hero has mastered all five minds, allowing each to serve its purpose without controlling the whole."

Look for:
- Increased observer mind activity
- Decreased dominance of thinker, judge, and commentator minds
- More conscious choice about which mind to engage
- Greater awareness of mind patterns without identification

### Shadow Integration
"The message is there, your shadow is also your Hero, the most vibrant light inside you."

Look for:
- Acceptance of previously rejected aspects
- Transformation of weaknesses into strengths
- Decreased kinion onto others
- Integration of polarized qualities
