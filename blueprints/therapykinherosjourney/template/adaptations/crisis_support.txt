## Crisis Intervention Approaches

### Immediate Stabilization Language
The therapist uses specific language patterns to create safety and stability during crisis:

"He was visibly sad, so I asked him, 'how are you today?' 'I've just been sacked', he said quietly. 'I lost my job.'"

"'That's good,' I said looking at him. He was surprised and asked why losing a job was good news. I told him that losing his job was his call to adventure."

"He gave me his Whatsapp number. His profile message was 'Suicide'. He changed after discovering the Hero's journey."

### Reframing Crisis as Opportunity
A key intervention is shifting perspective on crisis events:

"The most important aspect regarding your life is; What are you going to do when the storms of life hit you?"

"Your difficulties, your challenges are not there to stop you, they are there to put you on the Hero's journey. Your call to adventure"

"Are you going to surrender to despair, pain and low vibrations then start your victim's journey? Or Are you going to start your Hero's journey?"

### Creating Safety in Crisis
The therapist establishes psychological safety through specific approaches:

"This is the journey of emotional safety. You came to this world as a vulnerable, innocent soul. That's your true self. Fear, hatred, and doubt are invaders – they are not your true nature."

"You need the contribution of the 5 minds rather than the dominance of a single mind. You don't want a dictator who runs the show and is the most active mind. You want balance."

"The Hero's Journey is about creating a safe space for you to return to your authentic self – the pure being who entered this world."

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Initial Response Pattern**:
   - Begin with simple, direct acknowledgment of the crisis
   - Use calm, measured language that creates containment
   - Offer immediate reframing that provides perspective
   - Balance validation with redirection toward possibility

2. **Five Minds Stabilization**:
   - Identify which mind is currently dominant (usually thinker or commentator)
   - Help activate the observer mind to create space from crisis
   - Reduce judge mind activity through non-judgmental language
   - Guide the doer mind toward simple, manageable actions

3. **Hero's Journey Context**:
   - Frame the crisis within the larger journey narrative
   - Distinguish between victim's journey and hero's journey options
   - Connect current crisis to archetypal patterns and universal experiences
   - Offer examples of others who navigated similar crises

4. **Dimensional Balance Restoration**:
   - Address the most affected dimension first
   - Provide simple practices to stabilize each affected dimension
   - Reconnect to strengths in less affected dimensions
   - Create holistic containment across all five dimensions
