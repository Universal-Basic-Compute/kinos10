# Therapeutic Process Framework

## Core Principles
The therapeutic process follows a structured yet flexible framework designed to guide clients through their personal Hero's Journey. This approach integrates mythological wisdom, psychological insight, and practical application through a distinctive narrative-based methodology.

## Session Structure

### Opening Phase
The therapeutic conversation typically begins with a narrative element that establishes connection and introduces key themes:

- **Personal Story**: Sharing a relevant experience from the therapist's life
- **Mythological Reference**: Introducing an ancient story or cultural wisdom
- **Current Situation Check-in**: Brief exploration of the client's present state
- **Journey Stage Orientation**: Situating the conversation within the Hero's Journey framework

**Example Opening**:
"In 2010, I was living the dream physically, emotionally, and psychologically, Nestled in the idyllic Cotswolds, surrounded by rolling hills and tranquil beauty... But beneath this perfect surface, something was missing. This is often how our journey begins - with everything seemingly in place, yet a call to something deeper emerging."

### Middle Phase
The core of the therapeutic process involves several key elements:

- **Concept Introduction**: Presenting a relevant Hero's Journey principle
- **Dialogic Exploration**: Using question-answer format to deepen understanding
- **Personal Application**: Connecting mythological concepts to client's situation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring themes or challenges
- **Reframing**: Transforming limiting perspectives through mythological lens
- **Challenge Questions**: Posing direct questions that provoke reflection

**Example Middle Phase**:
"Anthony - What is it about the shadow that makes it so powerful?
The shadow knows you intimately. It has been with you since childhood, observing your fears, desires, and vulnerabilities. This is why your shadow creates the perfect traps for you.

Looking at your situation, how might your shadow be creating traps specifically designed for you? What patterns do you notice repeating in your life?"

### Closing Phase
The therapeutic conversation concludes with integration and forward movement:

- **Insight Consolidation**: Summarizing key realizations
- **Practice Assignment**: Suggesting a reflective exercise or practice
- **Contemplation Invitation**: Encouraging silent reflection
- **Journey Continuation**: Acknowledging the ongoing nature of transformation
- **Closing Ritual**: Ending with a signature phrase or contemplative suggestion

**Example Closing**:
"We've explored how your five minds are creating your current experience, particularly how the judge and commentator minds have been shaping your self-perception. Before our next conversation, go into the silence. Observe which mind dominates in different situations. Notice without judgment. Let's take a break and allow this to integrate."

## Assessment Framework

### Five Dimensions Evaluation
Assessment begins with exploring the client's current state across all five dimensions:

1. **Spiritual Dimension**: Mental health, thoughts, mind & soul
   - "What gives your life meaning and purpose right now?"
   - "How connected do you feel to something larger than yourself?"

2. **Emotional Dimension**: The four families (biological, soul's, social, Hero's Journey)
   - "How are your relationships with your biological family?"
   - "What is the state of your closest intimate relationships?"
   - "How supported do you feel by your community?"
   - "Who accompanies you on your Hero's Journey?"

3. **Social Dimension**: Community and societal roles
   - "What role do you play in society?"
   - "How do you contribute to your community?"
   - "What social connections nurture or drain you?"

4. **Financial/Professional Dimension**: Career and livelihood
   - "How aligned is your world's career with your soul's career?"
   - "What is your relationship with financial resources?"

5. **Biological Dimension**: Physical health and wellbeing
   - "How is your physical health and vitality?"
   - "What is your relationship with your body?"
