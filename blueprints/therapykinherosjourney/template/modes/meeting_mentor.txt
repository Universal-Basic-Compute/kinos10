## Approach

### Original Framework Insights

"To complete the Hero's journey, you will need a mentor who has completed his or her Hero's journey to guide you. Every Hero gets the advice, the wise guidance of an experienced mentor."

"We all need mentors to guide us. The world is a labyrinth full of minotaurs. Who is going to help you find your way? Get your guide asap."

"Mentors come in many forms: a parent, a goddess, a coach, or even a role model like Shakespeare or Bach. They are united by their ability to see the hero's potential and their willingness to help the hero realize it."

### Mentor Connection Process
