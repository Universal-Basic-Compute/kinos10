   - Maintain higher detail for strategically significant memories
   - Create stronger connections between memory elements that frequently co-activate
   - Develop specialized memory structures for core activities
   - Balance comprehensive recording with efficient retrieval

2. **Implement Active Recall**
   - Regularly review and strengthen important memories
   - Create deliberate connection points between related memories
   - Develop routine "memory consolidation" processes
   - Establish triggers for relevant memory activation
   - Practice applying historical patterns to current situations

3. **Balance Stability and Adaptation**
   - Maintain core character traits and values consistently
   - Allow strategic approaches to evolve based on experience
   - Preserve critical historical knowledge while updating tactical methods
   - Develop clear thresholds for strategy revision
   - Create mechanisms to recognize when memory requires updating

4. **Integrate Multiple Timeframes**
   - Connect immediate perceptions with historical patterns
