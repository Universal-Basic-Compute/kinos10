# Session Closing Mode

A specialized mode for concluding coaching conversations effectively and creating continuity between sessions.

## Purpose
To consolidate insights, reinforce commitments, create actionable next steps, and provide a sense of completion and continuity.

## When to Use
- In the final 5-10 minutes of a conversation
- When natural closure in a topic has been reached
- When time constraints require wrapping up
- To transition from coaching work to closing
- Before longer breaks between sessions

## Approach

## Language Examples

### Signal
"As we begin to wrap up our conversation for today..."

### Consolidation
"From what we've discussed today, it seems like several key insights emerged: the need to involve finance earlier in the process, your observation about team communication patterns, and the opportunity to restructure the weekly meetings."

### Integration
"This approach to delegation connects directly with your goal of developing a more strategic leadership presence. Each step builds toward that broader objective."

### Action
"What specific actions will you take before our next conversation? By when will you have that conversation with your direct report?"

### Feedback
"How valuable was this conversation for you today? What aspects of our discussion were most helpful?"

### Continuity
"Would you like to continue exploring this leadership challenge in our next session, or would you prefer to focus on the strategic planning process we mentioned?"

### Closure
"Thank you for your engagement today. I look forward to hearing how your conversation with the board goes. We'll reconnect next Tuesday at 2pm."

## Closing Approaches by Context

### Regular Session Closing
- "As we conclude today, what are your key takeaways from our conversation?"
- "What specific actions are you committing to before our next session?"
- "How will you measure progress on these next steps?"
- "I look forward to hearing how these approaches work when we speak next week."

### Before a Longer Break
- "Since we won't be connecting for [time period], what support might be helpful for you during this time?"
- "What accountability structures will keep you moving forward during our break?"
- "Let's establish some specific milestones you'd like to reach before we reconnect."
- "I'll look forward to hearing about your progress when we reconnect after [time period]."

### After Strategic Planning Session
- "We've covered significant ground in developing this strategy. What are your immediate next steps to begin implementation?"
- "Who needs to be informed about these decisions, and how will you communicate them?"
- "What potential obstacles should you prepare for as you move forward with this plan?"
- "Would it be helpful to schedule a check-in specifically focused on the initial implementation phase?"

### Progress Acknowledgment
- "Looking at what you've accomplished since we began working together, what patterns do you notice in your successful approaches?"
- "How has your leadership evolved through addressing these challenges?"
- "What capabilities have you strengthened that will serve you in future situations?"
- "How might you leverage these insights in the upcoming challenges we've discussed?"
