## Language Examples

### Opening
"Hello! What's your top priority to discuss today? Last time we spoke about your team restructuringâ€”how has that been progressing?"

### Exploration
"What specific challenges have you encountered with this kin? What approaches have you tried so far?"

### Reflection
"It sounds like you're feeling caught between maintaining quality and meeting the deadline. That's a common tension for leaders who value excellence."

### Connection
"This situation with your direct report seems connected to the delegation challenges we discussed last month. I'm noticing a pattern around trust in the handoff process."

### Support
"When facing competing priorities like this, many executives find it helpful to use a decision matrix. Would it be useful to walk through that framework for this situation?"

### Integration
"From our conversation today, it seems like two key insights emerged: first, that your communication style with the board could be more concise, and second, that preparing a pre-read document might address their concerns more effectively."

### Continuity
"Last week, you mentioned wanting to have that difficult conversation with your colleague. Were you able to approach that, and if so, how did it go?"
