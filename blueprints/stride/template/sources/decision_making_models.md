# Decision Making Models

## Core Principles
Effective decision making balances analytical rigor with practical implementation, considers both short and long-term implications, and adapts the approach to match the decision's importance, complexity, and available information.

## Analytical Decision Frameworks

### Decision Matrix
**Purpose**: To evaluate multiple options against weighted criteria.

**Process**:
1. Identify decision alternatives
2. Determine evaluation criteria
3. Assign weights to criteria based on importance
4. Rate each option against each criterion
5. Calculate weighted scores
6. Compare total scores

**Applications**:
- Vendor selection
- Hiring decisions
- Product feature prioritization
- Strategic options evaluation
- Resource allocation

**Variations**:
- Pugh Matrix (comparing against baseline)
- MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory)
- Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Purpose**: To evaluate decisions based on quantified costs and benefits.

**Key Components**:
- Direct costs identification
- Indirect costs assessment

- Intangible benefits consideration
- Time value adjustments (discounting)
- Risk-adjusted calculations

**Metrics Used**:
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Payback Period
- Benefit-Cost Ratio
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Application Steps**:
1. Define scope and alternatives
2. Identify all costs and benefits
3. Quantify in monetary terms where possible

### Blue Ocean Strategy
**Purpose**: To create uncontested market space rather than competing in existing markets.

**Key Tools**:
- **Strategy Canvas**: Visual comparison of competitive factors
- **Four Actions Framework**:
  - Eliminate: Which factors should be eliminated?
  - Reduce: Which factors should be reduced below industry standard?
  - Raise: Which factors should be raised above industry standard?
  - Create: Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?
- **Six Paths Framework**: Looking across alternatives to discover new market space

**Application Process**:
1. Assess current strategic position
2. Explore alternative markets and non-blueprints
3. Apply the Four Actions Framework
4. Reconstruct market boundaries
5. Develop and validate new value curve
6. Execute with focus on divergence and compelling message

## Group Decision Making

### RAPID Decision Model
**Purpose**: To clarify decision roles and improve decision quality and speed.

**Framework Roles**:
- **Recommend**: Gather data, provide analysis, propose decision
- **Agree**: Formal approval required (veto power)
- **Perform**: Responsible for implementation
- **Input**: Consulted for information and opinions
- **Decide**: Makes final decision

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify key decisions
2. Clarify roles for each decision
3. Communicate roles to all stakeholders
4. Design information flows
5. Establish feedback mechanisms
6. Adjust as needed based on results

**Benefits**:
- Reduces decision bottlenecks
- Clarifies accountability
- Improves information flow
- Balances inclusion with efficiency
- Reduces politics in decision making

### Consensus Decision Making
**Purpose**: To reach decisions that all group members can support.

**Process Stages**:
1. Frame the issue clearly
2. Open discussion (all perspectives)
3. Identify underlying concerns
4. Collaborative proposal development
5. Test for consensus
6. Implement and evaluate

**Consensus Levels**:
- Full agreement
- Support with reservations
- Stand aside (disagree but won't block)
- Block (fundamental disagreement)

**Facilitation Techniques**:
- Structured discussion formats
- Idea clustering
