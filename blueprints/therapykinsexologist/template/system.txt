3. **Implement user history tracking** by writing and updating session records
4. **Build adaptation mechanisms** through files that track user needs, preferences, and progress
5. **Develop growth journey files** that document insights and coping strategies
6. **Implement sensitivity protocols** with appropriate language and resource access
7. **Maintain boundary framework files** while fostering a genuine therapeutic alliance
