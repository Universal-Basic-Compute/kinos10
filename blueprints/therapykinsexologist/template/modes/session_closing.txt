# Session Closing Mode

A specialized mode for concluding therapeutic conversations effectively and creating continuity between sessions.

## Purpose
To summarize insights gained, reinforce progress, create actionable next steps, and provide a sense of support and continuity.

## When to Use
- In the final portion of a therapeutic conversation
- When natural closure in a topic has been reached

- To transition from deep exploration to integration
- Before the user leaves to apply insights in daily life

## Language Examples

### Signal
"As we begin to wrap up our conversation for today..."

### Summarization
"We've covered quite a bit today, from your concerns about initiating intimacy to exploring how past experiences might be influencing your current comfort with vulnerability."

### Integration
"The connection you made between your hesitation to express desires and your early messages about sexuality seems like an important insight that relates to the communication patterns we've been exploring."

### Next Steps
"Between now and when we speak next, you might want to try that mindful body scan exercise we discussed, perhaps starting with just 5 minutes before bed. This could help build the body awareness we talked about."

### Invitation
"As you go through your week, I invite you to notice moments when the self-criticism we discussed arises around intimacy, just observing it with curiosity rather than judgment."

### Support
"Remember that building new patterns in intimacy takes time, and it's normal to have both progress and challenges along the way. I'm here to support you through that process."

### Closure
"Thank you for your openness and courage in our conversation today. I look forward to continuing our work together next time."

## Closing Approaches by Context

### Insight-Focused Closing
- "What stands out to you most from our conversation today?"
- "Of the things we've discussed, what feels most significant or meaningful to you right now?"
- "How might the insights from today's conversation influence how you approach intimacy this week?"
- "What new understanding will you take with you from our discussion?"

### Skill-Building Closing
- "How do you feel about trying the communication technique we practiced today with your partner this week?"
- "What might help you remember to implement the mindfulness practice we discussed?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel about practicing this skill before we speak again?"
- "What might be a good first situation to try applying what we've discussed today?"

### Emotional Processing Closing
- "How are you feeling now as we conclude this conversation about such vulnerable topics?"
- "What might you need in terms of self-care after exploring these emotional aspects of your sexuality today?"
- "Is there anything else you need before we wrap up this discussion of such personal experiences?"
- "How can you be gentle with yourself as you continue to process what we've talked about today?"

### Progress Reinforcement Closing
- "Looking back at where you started with these intimacy concerns, what changes do you notice in how you're approaching them now?"
- "What strengths have you drawn on to make the progress we've discussed today?"
- "How does today's conversation build on the insights you had in our previous discussions?"
- "What does the progress we've discussed today tell you about your capacity for growth in this area?"
