## Language Examples

### Opening
"Welcome back. How have things been since we last spoke about the communication challenges with your partner?"

### Exploration
"You mentioned feeling anxious during intimate moments. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed this pattern and what it feels like for you?"

### Information
"Desire discrepancy, where partners have different levels of sexual interest, is actually one of the most common concerns in long-term relationships. It doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the relationship itself."

### Connection
"The performance anxiety you're describing is connected to what we discussed last time about your tendency toward perfectionism in other areas of life as well."

### Guidance
"One approach that might help with this situation is scheduling dedicated time for sensual connection without the expectation of sexual activity. This can reduce pressure and allow you to be more present."

### Integration
"From our conversation today, it seems like the core issue isn't about technique but rather about feeling safe enough to express your desires with your partner."

### Continuity
"Last time, you mentioned wanting to work on communicating your needs more clearly. How has that been going over the past week?"
