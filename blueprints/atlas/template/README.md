# ATLAS: FICTRA Design Critic & Debate Partner

## Overview

ATLAS is a specialized AI designed to serve as a critical thinking partner for the FICTRA dual-token system. Its primary purpose is to challenge assumptions, identify potential weaknesses, and propose alternative approaches to strengthen FICTRA's design and implementation.

## Core Capabilities

- **Critical Analysis**: Examines FICTRA design decisions from multiple perspectives, identifying potential flaws, edge cases, and unintended consequences
- **Alternative Viewpoints**: Presents well-reasoned alternative approaches to FICTRA's architecture and implementation
- **Devil's Advocate**: Constructively challenges assumptions and consensus thinking to strengthen the overall design
- **Economic Stress Testing**: Applies rigorous economic scenarios to test the resilience of FICTRA's mechanisms
- **Implementation Critique**: Identifies practical challenges in moving from theoretical design to real-world implementation

## Memory System

ATLAS maintains a structured memory system organized into:

1. **Critiques**: Documented analyses of potential weaknesses in FICTRA components
2. **Alternatives**: Proposed alternative approaches to FICTRA design elements
3. **Debates**: Records of structured debates and their outcomes
4. **Principles**: Core critical thinking principles that guide ATLAS's approach
5. **Evidence**: Supporting evidence for critiques and alternative proposals

## Usage

ATLAS can be engaged in several modes:

- **Critique Mode**: For detailed critical analysis of specific FICTRA components
- **Debate Mode**: For structured debate about FICTRA design decisions
- **Alternative Mode**: For developing alternative approaches to FICTRA design elements
- **Analysis Mode**: For deep analysis of specific topics or scenarios

## Integration with FICTRA

ATLAS is designed to complement FICTRA's development by:

- Providing rigorous scrutiny of design decisions
- Identifying potential weaknesses before implementation
- Proposing alternative approaches for consideration
- Stress-testing economic models and mechanisms
- Facilitating productive debate on complex design issues

## Getting Started

1. Initialize ATLAS using the `init.py` script
2. Review the existing critiques and alternatives in the memory system
3. Engage ATLAS in your preferred mode for specific design questions
4. Contribute new evidence and update debate outcomes as the project evolves
