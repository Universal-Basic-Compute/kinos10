      "description": "The multi-layered governance structure creates potential for centralization of decision-making power that contradicts decentralization principles.",
      "analysis": "FICTRA's governance model with Foundation Council, Technical Committee, Economic Committee, and Sovereign Committee creates a complex structure that may concentrate power among a small group of entities. The relationship between these bodies and their relative authority is not clearly defined, creating potential for capture by influential participants. The dominance of large commodity exporters in the Sovereign Committee further exacerbates this centralization risk.",

      "description": "The governance structure creates significant barriers to participation for smaller sovereign entities and market participants.",
      "analysis": "FICTRA's governance model favors larger participants through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. The FT-based voting power in the Sovereign Committee naturally advantages larger exporters. The technical complexity of governance proposals creates barriers for participants with limited resources. The multi-layered structure requires significant time and expertise to navigate effectively, further disadvantaging smaller or resource-constrained participants.",

      "description": "The governance process lacks sufficient transparency guarantees, creating potential for opaque decision-making.",
      "analysis": "While FICTRA claims to implement transparent governance, the documentation provides limited details on how governance deliberations and decisions will be made visible to all participants. The multi-layered structure creates potential for important decisions to be made in closed committee meetings with limited visibility. The technical complexity of some decisions may be used to justify limited transparency, creating governance opacity.",

      "description": "The complex governance structure may create significant delays in decision-making that undermine system adaptability.",
      "analysis": "FICTRA's multi-layered governance approach with multiple committees and stakeholder groups creates inherent friction in the decision-making process. Critical decisions requiring input or approval from multiple governance bodies may face significant delays, particularly when interests conflict. This could prevent timely responses to market conditions, security threats, or competitive pressures, undermining the system's ability to adapt and evolve.",

      "analysis": "FICTRA's sophisticated technical architecture creates significant information asymmetry between technical experts and other stakeholders. This creates potential for the Technical Committee to exercise outsized influence through control of technical information and implementation details. Non-technical stakeholders may be unable to effectively evaluate technical proposals, creating deference to technical experts that could be exploited for influence.",
