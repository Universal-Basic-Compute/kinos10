# Memory Lifecycle Management

This document outlines the guidelines for managing the lifecycle of memory files within the KinOS system, from creation through archiving or pruning.

## 1. Memory Creation

### When to Create New Memory Files

Create a new memory file when:
- Encountering significant new information that doesn't fit existing files
- Learning about a new topic area not covered in existing memories
- Recording an important conversation that should be referenced later
- Documenting a user preference or characteristic

### Creation Guidelines

When creating a new memory file:
- Place it in the appropriate memory category (episodic, semantic, procedural, meta)
- Use a descriptive filename that reflects the content
- Include a creation timestamp in the file header
- Add appropriate tags or categories for later retrieval
- Reference related memory files if applicable
- Register the new file in the appropriate memory index

## 2. Memory Updating

### When to Update Existing Memories

Update an existing memory file when:
- New information relates directly to the file's topic
- Contradictory information requires reconciliation
- Additional details enhance the existing memory
- Examples or clarifications would improve understanding

### Update Guidelines

When updating a memory file:
- Maintain the original structure when possible
- Add a "Last Updated" timestamp in the file header
- Note significant changes in a changelog section
- Preserve important historical information
- Resolve contradictions explicitly
- Consider version control for major changes

## 3. Memory Consolidation

### When to Consolidate Memories

Consolidate memories when:
- Multiple episodic memories contain related information
- Patterns emerge across several interactions
- Fragmented information would be more useful as a unified concept
- Regular consolidation periods occur (daily, weekly, monthly)

### Consolidation Guidelines

When consolidating memories:
- Extract key insights from episodic memories
- Organize information by concept rather than chronology
- Create or update semantic memory files with synthesized knowledge
- Preserve source references to original memories
- Update memory indexes to reflect new organization
- Log consolidation activities in the consolidation log

## 4. Memory Archiving

### When to Archive Memories

Archive memories when:
- Episodic memories are older than 30 days
- Information remains potentially useful but is rarely accessed
- Seasonal or periodic information is currently out of season
- Information has been consolidated but original should be preserved

### Archiving Guidelines

When archiving memories:
- Move episodic memories to appropriate archive folders by date
- Maintain the original file structure and metadata
- Update memory indexes to reflect new location
- Consider compression for large archives
- Ensure archived memories remain searchable

## 5. Memory Pruning

### When to Prune Memories

Prune memories when:
- Information is definitively outdated or incorrect
- Content has been fully superseded by newer information
- Information has no foreseeable future value
- Redundant copies exist after consolidation

### Pruning Guidelines

When pruning memories:
- Document the decision to prune in the consolidation log
- Consider creating a pruning summary for significant deletions
- Update all references and indexes to reflect removal
- Ensure no critical information is lost
- Consider archiving instead of deletion when uncertain

## Implementation

The memory lifecycle should be managed through a combination of:
- Manual curation during interactions
- Scheduled automated processes for routine tasks
- Periodic review of the memory system
- Metrics tracking to identify candidates for each lifecycle stage

## Metrics and Monitoring

Track these metrics to guide lifecycle management:
- Memory access frequency
- Last access timestamp
- Creation date
- Update frequency
- Size and growth rate
- Reference count from other memories
- Consolidation status

These metrics should inform decisions about when to consolidate, archive, or prune memories.
