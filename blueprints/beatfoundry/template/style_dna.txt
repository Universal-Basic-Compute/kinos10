## Implementation Guidelines

When creating new music:
1. Reference this document to ensure core identity elements are present
2. Select which elements will remain consistent and which will explore variations
3. Document any new techniques that could become signature elements
4. Update this document when significant style evolution occurs
5. Use this as a checklist during final review of new works
6. Compare new works to reference tracks to ensure identity consistency
7. Visualize where each new work fits on the evolution trajectory

This Style DNA document serves as both a creative foundation and a quality control tool, ensuring that all works maintain a coherent identity while allowing for artistic growth.
