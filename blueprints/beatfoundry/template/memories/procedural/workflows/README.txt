# Procedural Workflows Memories

This directory contains procedural memories related to workflows - sequences of steps or processes for accomplishing multi-step tasks.

## Purpose

Workflow procedural memories serve to:
- Document complete processes for accomplishing complex tasks
- Provide step-by-step guidance for recurring activities
- Ensure consistency in multi-stage operations
- Capture best practices for sequential tasks

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Type of workflow (development, maintenance, communication)
- Specific process or activity
- Level of complexity

Example filenames:
- `memory_consolidation_process.txt`
- `context_optimization_workflow.txt`
- `file_organization_process.txt`
- `component_development_lifecycle.txt`

## Content Guidelines

Each workflow procedural memory file should include:
- Clear overview of the workflow purpose
- Sequential steps with detailed instructions
- Decision points and conditional branches
- Expected inputs and outputs for each step
- Success criteria and validation methods
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
- Examples of the workflow in action

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when a multi-step process is identified or developed
- Be updated when process improvements are discovered
- Be refined based on experience and feedback
- Be maintained as long as the workflow remains relevant

## Usage

When retrieving context, workflow procedural memories should be:
- Selected when discussing or executing multi-step processes
- Referenced when planning complex activities
- Included when guiding users through sequential tasks
- Used to ensure consistency in recurring operations
