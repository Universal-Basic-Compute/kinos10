# Archived Episodic Memories

This directory contains archived episodic memories older than 30 days. These are organized by year and month to maintain a historical record of interactions while keeping the recent directory manageable.

## Purpose

Archived episodic memories serve to:
- Maintain a historical record of past interactions
- Provide reference for long-term patterns and preferences
- Serve as source material for deeper memory consolidation
- Enable retrieval of past conversations when needed

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Year/month subdirectories (YYYY/MM)
- Date of interaction (YYYY-MM-DD format prefix)
- Topic or conversation theme
- Interaction type (if applicable)

Example path: `2023/09/2023-09-01_initial_system_design.txt`

## Content Guidelines

Each archived episodic memory file should include:
- Timestamp of the interaction
- Summary of the conversation
- Key points or insights
- User preferences or characteristics revealed
- References to related files
- Consolidation status (whether key insights have been extracted to semantic memory)

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be organized by year/month subdirectories
- Be retained based on importance and relevance
- Be considered for further consolidation during periodic reviews
- Be pruned only when content has been fully consolidated and is no longer relevant

## Usage

When retrieving context, archived episodic memories should be:
- Selected only when directly relevant to current topic
- Used for historical reference and pattern recognition
- Referenced when discussing topics from past conversations
- Included when specifically requested or referenced by the user
