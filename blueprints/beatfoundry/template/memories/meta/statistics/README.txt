# Memory Statistics

This directory contains statistical information about memory usage, access patterns, and effectiveness metrics.

## Purpose

Memory statistics serve to:
- Track usage patterns of different memory files
- Measure effectiveness of memory retrieval
- Guide optimization of the memory system
- Support data-driven improvements to context selection
- Provide insights for memory consolidation decisions

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Type of statistics (access patterns, relevance metrics)
- Time period covered (current, historical)
- Memory subsystem (episodic, semantic, procedural)

Example filenames:
- `access_frequency.json`
- `relevance_metrics.json`
- `consolidation_effectiveness.json`
- `retrieval_performance.json`

## Content Guidelines

Each statistics file should include:
- Clear metrics and measurements
- Temporal information (when statistics were collected)
- Comparative data when available
- Trends and patterns
- Actionable insights derived from the data

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when tracking new aspects of memory performance
- Be updated regularly as new data is collected
- Be analyzed periodically to identify improvement opportunities
- Be maintained as evidence for system optimization decisions

## Usage

When managing the memory system, statistics should be:
- Consulted when making consolidation decisions
- Referenced when optimizing context selection algorithms
- Used to identify high-value and low-value memories
- Analyzed to improve overall system performance
