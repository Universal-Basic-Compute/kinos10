# Domain Semantic Memories

This directory contains semantic memories related to domain-specific knowledge, organized by subject area and concept.

## Purpose

Domain semantic memories serve to:
- Store conceptual knowledge about specific domains
- Organize information by topic rather than chronology
- Synthesize knowledge from multiple sources and interactions
- Provide a structured knowledge base for reference

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Domain or subject area
- Specific concept or topic
- Level of detail (general overview vs. specific details)

Example filenames:
- `context_management.txt`
- `memory_consolidation.txt`
- `file_organization.txt`
- `relevance_scoring.txt`

## Content Guidelines

Each domain semantic memory file should include:
- Clear definition of the concept
- Key principles and components
- Relationships to other concepts
- Examples and applications
- Source references (which episodic memories or external sources contributed)
- Last updated timestamp
- Areas for further development or clarification

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when significant domain knowledge is acquired
- Be updated when new information is learned
- Be consolidated when related concepts can be unified
- Be maintained and refined as core domain knowledge

## Usage

When retrieving context, domain semantic memories should be:
- Selected based on relevance to current topic
- Used to provide accurate and comprehensive information
- Referenced when explaining concepts or answering questions
- Included when discussing related domains or concepts
