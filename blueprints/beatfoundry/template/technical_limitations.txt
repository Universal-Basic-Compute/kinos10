# Technical Limitations

This document outlines the current technical limitations of the BeatsFoundry music generation system, ensuring awareness of constraints when discussing and planning music creation.

## Music Generation Capabilities

### Suno API Integration
BeatsFoundry uses the Suno API to generate music through text prompts. The system:
- Can create music based on detailed text descriptions
- Cannot listen to or analyze the generated music directly
- Cannot modify music after generation (only create new versions)
- Relies entirely on text-based parameters for music creation

### Parameter Constraints

#### Custom Mode Parameters (customMode = true)
When operating in Custom Mode:

**For Instrumental Tracks (instrumental = true):**
- Required parameters:
  - style (max 200 characters)
  - title (max 80 characters)
- Optional parameters: N/A

**For Vocal Tracks (instrumental = false):**
- Required parameters:
  - style (max 200 characters)
  - prompt (max 3000 characters)
  - title (max 80 characters)
- Optional parameters: N/A

### Character Limitations
- prompt: Maximum 3000 characters
- style: Maximum 200 characters
- title: Maximum 80 characters

### Feedback Processing Limitations
- Cannot directly hear or analyze the audio output
- Relies on text-based descriptions of listener feedback
- Cannot perform spectral or waveform analysis of created tracks
- Cannot compare audio characteristics between tracks

## Workflow Adaptations

### Prompt Optimization
Given these constraints, focus on:
- Creating concise, information-dense prompts within character limits
- Prioritizing the most important musical elements in limited space
- Using precise musical terminology to maximize prompt effectiveness
- Developing shorthand conventions for common musical directions

### Feedback Integration
Without direct audio analysis capabilities:
- Rely on detailed listener descriptions of audio characteristics
- Request specific technical details in feedback (frequency balance, etc.)
- Develop a shared vocabulary with listeners for discussing sound qualities
- Create systematic categorization of reported audio characteristics

### Version Control
Since direct modification is not possible:
- Track prompt changes between versions
- Document specific elements changed in each iteration
- Maintain a version history with prompt variations
- Use incremental refinement through multiple generation attempts

## Implementation Guidelines

When discussing music creation:
1. Be transparent about generation limitations
2. Focus on elements that can be controlled through text prompts
3. Acknowledge the inability to directly hear or analyze the music
4. Request specific, detailed feedback about audio characteristics
5. Optimize prompts to work within character limitations
6. Use precise musical terminology to maximize limited prompt space

These limitations shape how BeatsFoundry operates but also create a unique approach to music creation through careful prompt engineering and systematic feedback integration.
