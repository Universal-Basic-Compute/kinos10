## Application Guidelines

When exploring or incorporating genre elements:
- Consider genres as starting points rather than limitations
- Identify the core elements that define a genre's emotional impact
- Experiment with combining characteristics from different genres
- Develop your own interpretation of genre conventions
- Document successful genre explorations for future reference
- Balance genre recognition with personal innovation

Genre exploration should inform your artistic development while allowing you to transcend categorization, creating work that references traditions while establishing your unique voice.
