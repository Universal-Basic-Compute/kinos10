# Data Storage & Privacy Architecture

## Executive Summary

The FICTRA platform's Data Storage & Privacy Architecture is designed to meet the complex requirements of a global commodity trading system while maintaining the highest standards of data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. This document outlines the comprehensive technical architecture that underpins our dual-token system, focusing on data storage strategies, privacy mechanisms, compliance frameworks, and security protocols.

Our architecture balances several critical priorities:
- Ensuring transaction data integrity and immutability
- Protecting sensitive sovereign and commercial information
- Enabling selective transparency for verification and compliance
- Maintaining scalability for global transaction volumes
- Supporting regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions
- Allowing secure data exchange between participants

This architecture document serves as the authoritative reference for the FICTRA technical team responsible for implementing, maintaining, and evolving our data storage and privacy infrastructure.

## 1. Architectural Overview

### 1.1 Core Architecture Principles

The FICTRA data architecture adheres to the following foundational principles:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are integrated into every component from inception, not added as an afterthought
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect data, ensuring no single point of failure
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear delineation between public and private data domains
4. **Selective Transparency**: Granular control over what data is visible to different stakeholders
5. **Jurisdictional Flexibility**: Adaptability to varying regulatory requirements across regions
6. **Scalable Performance**: Architecture can handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising security
7. **Auditability**: Comprehensive audit trails for all data access and modifications

### 1.2 System Architecture Layers

The data architecture is organized into four distinct layers:

| Layer | Description | Key Components |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Blockchain Layer** | Immutable public transaction records | Smart contracts, Payment Token transactions, verification records |
| **Protected Data Layer** | Confidential transaction details | Foundation Token allocations, sovereign entity data, trading counterparty information |
| **Operational Data Layer** | System operational data | User accounts, market statistics, analytics data, system logs |
| **Integration Layer** | External system connections | APIs, oracles, regulatory reporting interfaces, exchange connectors |

### 1.3 Data Classification Framework

All data within the FICTRA ecosystem is classified according to sensitivity:

1. **Public Data (Level 1)**: Openly accessible information (e.g., PT market prices, system status)
2. **Restricted Data (Level 2)**: Limited access information (e.g., aggregated trade volumes, anonymized market trends)
3. **Confidential Data (Level 3)**: Sensitive business information (e.g., individual transaction details, participant identities)
4. **Sovereign Data (Level 4)**: Highly sensitive government information (e.g., FT allocations, strategic reserves)

## 2. Blockchain Storage Architecture

### 2.1 Blockchain Selection Rationale

FICTRA's architecture is built on the Ethereum blockchain for several strategic reasons:

- **Institutional Trust**: Ethereum has achieved widespread institutional acceptance
- **Smart Contract Capabilities**: Mature and secure programmable transaction framework
- **Security Track Record**: Robust security history with extensive auditing resources
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Large pool of security-focused developers and auditors
- **Enterprise Tooling**: Well-established tools for enterprise integration

While Ethereum serves as our foundational layer, our architecture is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, allowing for future migration or multi-chain operation if required.

### 2.2 On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Storage

Our architecture implements a hybrid storage model that carefully balances on-chain and off-chain storage:

#### 2.2.1 On-Chain Storage Components

- Payment Token transaction records
- Smart contract code for transaction validation
- Oracle verification confirmations
- System governance decisions
- Cryptographic proofs of off-chain data integrity

#### 2.2.2 Off-Chain Storage Components

- Detailed transaction documentation
- Foundation Token allocation details
- User identification information
- Supporting documentation for verification
- Historical analytics data

### 2.3 Smart Contract Data Architecture

The smart contract architecture implements a modular design with specialized data structures for different aspects of the system:

```solidity
// Simplified example of modular contract structure
contract PaymentTokenRegistry {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(bytes32 => Transaction) private transactions;
    
    struct Transaction {
        address sender;
        address recipient;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 commodityHash; // Hash of off-chain commodity details
        VerificationStatus status;
    }
    
    enum VerificationStatus { Pending, Verified, Rejected }
    
    // Additional functions and access controls...
}

contract VerificationOracle {
    mapping(bytes32 => VerificationData) private verifications;
    
    struct VerificationData {
        bytes32 transactionHash;
        address[] verifiers;
        mapping(address => bool) hasVerified;
        uint256 requiredVerifications;
        uint256 completedVerifications;
    }
    
    // Verification logic and security controls...
}

contract FoundationTokenController {
    // Restricted access controller for FT allocations
    // Only accessible by authorized foundation entities
    
    mapping(bytes32 => SovereignAllocation) private allocations;
    
    struct SovereignAllocation {
        bytes32 sovereignEntityId; // Hashed identifier
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 transactionReferenceHash;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    
    // Access control and allocation logic...
}
```

### 2.4 State Channel Implementation

To enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs, the architecture implements state channels for high-volume transaction processing:

- **Bilateral Channels**: For direct, repeated transactions between two parties
- **Multiparty Hubs**: For sovereign entity connections with multiple trading partners
- **Challenge Protocols**: To ensure accurate state resolution in case of disputes
- **Periodic Settlement**: Aggregated transactions are settled on-chain at determined intervals

## 3. Off-Chain Storage Architecture

```
// Simplified ZKP verification pseudocode
function verifyTransactionCompliance(
    bytes publicParameters,
    bytes proof,
    bytes32 transactionHash
) public view returns (bool) {
    // Verify that a transaction meets compliance requirements
    // without revealing sensitive details about the transaction
    
    // 1. Extract public inputs from the public parameters
    PublicInputs memory inputs = decodePublicInputs(publicParameters);
    
    // 2. Verify proof against the circuit verification key
    bool isValid = zkVerifier.verify(
        complianceCircuitKey,
        inputs.instanceHash,
        proof
    );
    
    // 3. Verify that the transaction hash matches the expected transaction
