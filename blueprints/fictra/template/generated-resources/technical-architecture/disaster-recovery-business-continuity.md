# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity for FICTRA

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) framework for the FICTRA platform. As a financial infrastructure supporting global commodity trading through a dual-token cryptocurrency system, FICTRA requires robust resilience measures to ensure uninterrupted operation even during adverse events. This document details the technical architecture, strategic considerations, and implementation protocols required to maintain the integrity, availability, and security of FICTRA's services.

The DR/BCP strategy is designed with a multi-layered approach, addressing system redundancy, geographical distribution, data protection, communication protocols, and recovery procedures. It accounts for both technological disruptions and wider threats, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, and unexpected market volatility.

## 2. System Architecture for Resilience

### 2.1 Blockchain Infrastructure Redundancy

FICTRA's blockchain infrastructure implements a comprehensive redundancy strategy to ensure continuous operation of token transactions:

- **Node Distribution**: Deployment of Ethereum nodes across multiple geographic regions with at least N+2 redundancy (where N represents the minimum nodes required for operations)
  
- **Node Diversity**: Implementation of different client implementations (Geth, OpenEthereum, Nethermind) to mitigate client-specific vulnerabilities

- **Consensus Mechanism Protection**: Specialized monitoring for consensus issues with automated detection of chain reorganizations or fork events

- **Private Sidechain Backups**: Parallel private chains that mirror main transactions for rapid recovery and verification

- **Transaction Queue Management**: Dedicated infrastructure for maintaining pending transactions during network congestion or temporary outages

```

Primary Region (EU)     |  Secondary Region (APAC)  |  Tertiary Region (Americas)
------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------
Validator Node 1 (Geth) |  Validator Node 3 (Geth)  |  Validator Node 5 (Geth)
Validator Node 2 (Open) |  Validator Node 4 (Neth)  |  Validator Node 6 (Open)
Archive Node 1          |  Archive Node 2           |  Archive Node 3
RPC Gateway (Active)    |  RPC Gateway (Passive)    |  RPC Gateway (Passive)
```

### 2.2 Data Protection and Replication

- **Real-time Data Replication**: Synchronous multi-region replication for critical blockchain data with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of < 1 second

- **Multi-tiered Storage Strategy**:
  - Hot storage: High-performance SSDs for active transaction data
  - Warm storage: Cost-effective storage for recent historical data
  - Cold storage: Archival systems for complete transaction history

- **Time-delayed Replication**: Additional protection against corruption or malicious changes with 1-hour delayed replicas

### 2.3 Oracle Network Resilience

The oracle network is crucial for verifying real-world commodity deliveries and triggering Foundation Token issuance:

- **Multi-source Verification**: Each delivery verification requires confirmation from at least 3 independent data sources

- **Staggered Updates**: Oracle nodes perform updates on a staggered schedule to prevent simultaneous failure

- **Consensus Requirements**: Minimum 2/3 majority required for verification consensus with fallback to manual verification if threshold not met

- **Cryptographic Attestation**: Each oracle node cryptographically signs its attestations to ensure integrity and non-repudiation

- **Circuit Breaking Logic**: Automatic suspension of verification for unusual patterns that may indicate compromise

### 2.4 Geographic Distribution Strategy

FICTRA implements a global infrastructure distribution strategy that balances resilience with performance:

- **Primary Operations**: Based in Geneva (Switzerland) data centers with full operational capability

- **Secondary Operations**: Singapore (APAC) and New York (Americas) with hot standby capacity that can assume primary operations within 5 minutes

- **Tertiary Backups**: Additional backup facilities in Frankfurt (EU) and Sydney (APAC) for geographic diversity

- **Cross-region Routing**: Intelligent traffic management system that can route requests to the nearest operational data center

- **Sovereign Data Considerations**: Country-specific data handling in compliance with data residency requirements for participating governments

### 2.5 Network Architecture

- **Multi-provider Strategy**: At least two independent telecommunications providers per region with automatic failover

- **BGP Route Optimization**: Advanced Border Gateway Protocol configuration to detect and route around internet disruptions

- **Zero-trust Architecture**: No implicit trust between system components, with continuous authentication and authorization

- **Segmentation**: Strict network segmentation between critical system components with dedicated security controls

- **DDoS Protection**: Multiple layers of protection including:
  - Volumetric attack mitigation at network edge
  - Protocol-based attack filtering
  - Application layer protection
  - Traffic analysis for anomaly detection
