3. **Secure by Design**: Security integrated into the development lifecycle from inception
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and alerting systems
5. **Verifiable Compliance**: Transparent and auditable security controls

### 1.2 Threat Landscape Analysis

The FICTRA platform faces several categories of threats:

| Threat Category | Description | Risk Level | Specific Examples |
