# FICTRA Launch Timeline - Small Team Edition

## Executive Summary

This document provides a streamlined timeline for the FICTRA platform launch, adapted for implementation by a small team. It outlines essential activities, key milestones, and core responsibilities from preparation through the initial post-launch period. The timeline prioritizes critical functionality while maintaining the integrity of FICTRA's vision.

The launch process is divided into four extended phases: Preparation (T-180 to T-60 days), Pre-Launch (T-60 to T-14 days), Launch Week (T-14 to T-0), and Post-Launch Stabilization (T+1 to T+60). Each phase focuses on must-have deliverables with realistic timeframes for a small team, ensuring the platform's core functionality, security, and basic market operations are properly established before launch.

This timeline serves as the primary coordination tool for the FICTRA launch team and includes simplified contingency protocols and clear decision frameworks appropriate for a small organization. Regular review of this document will help maintain alignment and focus throughout the launch process.

## Conclusion

This FICTRA Launch Timeline provides a realistic roadmap for a small team to successfully launch the platform. By focusing on essential elements, extending timeframes, and simplifying processes, this approach maximizes the likelihood of a successful launch while working within the constraints of limited resources.

The timeline prioritizes core functionality, basic market operations, and essential participant engagement while deferring more complex features to post-launch phases. Regular assessment points and straightforward contingency plans provide the flexibility to adapt to challenges while maintaining focus on the most critical launch objectives.

## Transition to Post-Launch Enhancement Plan

At the conclusion of the 60-day post-launch stabilization period, a formal transition will occur to the Post-Launch Enhancement Plan implementation:

### Transition Process

1. **Team Review Meeting** (T+60): Full team reviews launch performance and plans enhancement priorities
   - Assessment of system stability and performance
   - Review of participant feedback and market performance
   - Prioritization of enhancement opportunities

2. **Documentation Update**:
   - Consolidated launch performance summary
   - Participant feedback compilation
   - Technical improvement opportunities list
   - Updated risk assessment

3. **Initial Enhancement Priorities**:
   - Identify 3-5 highest impact improvements for immediate implementation
   - Create realistic timeline for enhancements based on team capacity
   - Develop phased approach to additional feature development

4. **Ongoing Development Process**:
   - Establish regular development and release cadence
   - Implement feedback loops with early participants
   - Create balanced roadmap addressing technical debt and new features

This streamlined transition ensures the small team can move from launch stabilization to sustainable enhancement while maintaining system stability and responding to market feedback.
