# Feature Prioritization Framework

# Feature Prioritization Framework for FICTRA

## Executive Summary

This document outlines FICTRA's comprehensive framework for prioritizing platform features and enhancements across our dual-token cryptocurrency system for global commodity trading. The framework balances technical requirements, market demands, strategic objectives, and resource constraints to ensure our development efforts maximize value delivery while maintaining platform stability and security. This structured approach enables consistent, transparent decision-making through quantifiable metrics while retaining flexibility for contextual considerations and emergent requirements.

## Purpose and Core Principles

### Purpose
The Feature Prioritization Framework provides a systematic methodology for evaluating, ranking, and scheduling feature development across FICTRA's ecosystem. It creates alignment between technical teams, business stakeholders, and sovereign participants through standardized evaluation criteria and transparent processes.

### Core Principles

1. **Value-Driven Development**
   - Features must create measurable value for at least one key stakeholder group
   - Development prioritizes high-impact functionality over nice-to-have features
   - Value assessment considers both immediate returns and strategic positioning

2. **Balanced Stakeholder Consideration**
   - All key stakeholder groups receive representation in prioritization decisions
   - Market participants, sovereign entities, and the Foundation each have voice
   - Features with cross-stakeholder benefits receive appropriate weighting

3. **Risk-Aware Approach**
   - Technical risk, market risk, and regulatory risk factor into prioritization
   - Higher-risk items require more robust justification and contingency planning
   - Risk mitigation features receive appropriate consideration

4. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Prioritization accounts for development cost, time, and resource constraints
   - Features that leverage existing capabilities receive appropriate consideration
   - Return on investment guides resource allocation decisions

5. **Strategic Alignment**
   - Features must align with FICTRA's long-term vision and roadmap
   - Strategic initiatives receive appropriate weighting vs. tactical enhancements
   - Prioritization occurs within strategic contexts, not isolation

   - Strategic alignment validation with Foundation leadership

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Features broken down into sprint-sized tasks
   - Development capacity allocated according to priority tiers
   - Critical and high-priority items receive precedence

3. **Mid-Quarter Adjustment**
   - Bi-weekly prioritization reviews allow for reprioritization
   - Emerging requirements evaluated against existing priorities
   - Limited resource reallocation permitted for critical needs

4. **Feature Completion**
   - Definition of Done includes prioritization verification
   - Delivered value assessed against initial prioritization score
   - Prioritization model refined based on outcome analysis

### Resource Allocation Model

Resources are allocated according to the following target distribution:
