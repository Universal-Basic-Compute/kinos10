| OTC Transaction | 0.10% - 0.25% | Invoiced monthly | 50% Operations, 40% Development, 10% Reserve |

Transaction fees represent the primary revenue source for the FICTRA platform, applied to all commodity transactions conducted using Payment Tokens (PT). These fees are structured to be significantly lower than traditional commodity trading costs while providing sustainable funding for platform operations.

#### Key Implementation Details:

- **Tiered Structure**: Fee percentages decrease with higher transaction volumes, incentivizing larger trades on the platform
- **Smart Contract Implementation**: Fees are automatically calculated and collected through smart contract execution
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Algorithmic adjustment based on:
  - Total platform transaction volume
  - Market volatility
  - Participant trading history
  - Commodity type

#### Strategic Considerations:

- Transaction fees are positioned well below the 1-3% typically charged by traditional commodity trading intermediaries
- The fee structure is designed to be competitive with other blockchain-based trading platforms while providing additional value through the dual-token mechanism
- Fees must be balanced to fund operations without creating barriers to adoption

### 2. Token Conversion Fees

The algorithm calculates fee adjustments in real-time with the following mathematical model:

```
Adjusted Fee = Base Fee × [1 + (Market Factor × 0.3) + (Participant Factor × 0.4) + (Economic Factor × 0.3)]

Where:
- Market Factor ranges from -0.2 to +0.2
- Participant Factor ranges from -0.5 to +0.1
- Economic Factor ranges from -0.1 to +0.2
```
