# Security Threat Modeling

# Security Threat Modeling for FICTRA

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive guidance on security threat modeling for the FICTRA dual-token cryptocurrency system. Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security risks within our platform. Given FICTRA's role in global commodity trading and our management of sovereign financial interests, robust security is not optional but foundational to our success.

The following sections outline our approach to threat modeling, specific threats to cryptocurrency trading platforms, mitigation strategies, and implementation guidelines tailored to FICTRA's unique dual-token architecture. This resource is intended for internal security teams, developers, and system architects to ensure consistent security practices across the platform.

## 1. Introduction to Threat Modeling

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

Threat modeling is a systematic process for identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system, evaluating their potential impact, and developing mitigation strategies. For FICTRA, effective threat modeling serves multiple critical purposes:

- **Risk identification**: Systematically discovering potential attack vectors before they can be exploited
- **Resource optimization**: Focusing security resources on the most critical vulnerabilities
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for cryptocurrency platforms and financial systems
- **Trust building**: Ensuring the platform's security to build trust with sovereign entities and market participants
- **Resilience development**: Creating systems that can withstand emerging threats in the cryptocurrency landscape

### 1.2 Threat Modeling in the Cryptocurrency Context

Cryptocurrency platforms face unique security challenges due to:

- **Financial incentives**: Direct monetary rewards for successful attackers
- **Irreversibility**: Once executed, blockchain transactions cannot be easily reversed
- **Distributed systems**: Complex attack surface spanning multiple nodes and participants
- **Novel technologies**: Emerging vulnerabilities in blockchain implementations
- **Cross-border operations**: Varying regulatory requirements and threat landscapes

FICTRA's dual-token system introduces additional complexities, including different security requirements for public Payment Tokens (PT) versus controlled-distribution Foundation Tokens (FT).

### 1.3 Key Threat Modeling Methodologies

| Methodology | Description | Best Application for FICTRA |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| STRIDE | Identifies threats in six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege | Smart contract development, wallet infrastructure |
| PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) | Risk-centric approach that aligns technical security requirements with business objectives | Overall platform architecture, business risk assessment |
| DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability) | Quantitative risk assessment model | Prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation |
| LINDDUN | Privacy-focused threat modeling framework (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, Non-compliance) | Sovereign entity data handling, FT allocation systems |

For FICTRA, we recommend a hybrid approach: STRIDE for technical component analysis and PASTA for system-wide assessment, with LINDDUN applied specifically to privacy-sensitive components involving sovereign entities.
