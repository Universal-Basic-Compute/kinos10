# Advisory Board Formation

# Advisory Board Formation: Internal Team Resource

## Executive Summary

The formation of FICTRA's Advisory Board represents a critical strategic initiative to enhance platform governance, bolster credibility, expand market reach, and ensure comprehensive subject matter expertise across our unique dual-token cryptocurrency system for global commodity trading.
