# KYC/AML Framework

# KYC/AML Framework for FICTRA

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework for the FICTRA dual-token cryptocurrency system. As a Foundation established in Switzerland with a global operational scope, FICTRA requires robust compliance mechanisms that satisfy regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions while maintaining operational efficiency. This framework has been designed to balance security, compliance, and user experience, with specific adaptations for both Payment Token (PT) and Foundation Token (FT) operations.

## 1. Regulatory Landscape Analysis

### 1.1 Key Regulatory Frameworks

| Jurisdiction | Key Regulations | Impact on FICTRA |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Switzerland | FINMA Guidelines for ICOs, AMLA | Primary regulatory framework as Swiss Foundation; sets baseline compliance requirements |
| European Union | 5AMLD, 6AMLD, MiCA | Affects operations with EU-based market participants and sovereign entities |
| United States | FinCEN regulations, BSA, OFAC compliance | Critical for USD conversion corridors and US participant access |
| International | FATF Recommendations | Global standards for AML/CFT that inform our multi-jurisdictional approach |

### 1.2 Unique Regulatory Considerations for FICTRA

1. **Dual-Token Structure Implications**
   - Payment Tokens (PT) require standard cryptocurrency compliance protocols
   - Foundation Tokens (FT) involve sovereign entities, necessitating diplomatic-level verification processes
   - Token interaction creates novel compliance challenges not addressed in existing frameworks

2. **Multi-jurisdictional Complexity**
   - Operations span global commodity trading networks
   - Need for compliance with diverse and sometimes conflicting regulatory requirements
   - Regulatory asymmetry between developed and developing economies

3. **Sovereign Entity Participation**
   - Governments subject to different verification standards than private entities
   - Diplomatic and political sensitivities in information collection
   - Need for secure sovereign identity verification while respecting national sovereignty

## 2. Risk-Based Approach Framework

### 2.1 Risk Assessment Methodology

Our risk assessment model evaluates participants along five dimensions:

1. **Entity Type Risk**
   - Market Participants: Variable risk based on type (trader, supplier, financial institution)
   - Sovereign Entities: Assessed based on international standing, governance indicators, and compliance history
   - Individual Users: Risk profiled by role, access level, and transaction capabilities

2. **Jurisdictional Risk**
   - FATF Grey/Black List consideration
   - Corruption Perception Index correlation
   - Regulatory maturity assessment
   - Sanctions and embargoes status

3. **Transaction Pattern Risk**
   - Volume anomalies
   - Frequency deviations
   - Timing irregularities
   - Commodity type concentration

4. **Counterparty Network Risk**
   - Connection to high-risk entities
   - Transaction pathway complexity
   - Historical relationship patterns
   - Network centrality metrics

5. **Verification History Risk**
   - Previous compliance issues
   - Documentation inconsistencies
   - Verification timeliness
   - Remediation effectiveness

### 2.2 Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Level | Score Range | Customer Due Diligence | Monitoring Frequency | Approval Level |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Low | 0-25 | Standard KYC | Annual review | Automated |
| Medium | 26-50 | Enhanced documentation | Bi-annual review | Compliance Officer |
| High | 51-75 | Extended verification + Senior review | Quarterly review | Compliance Committee |
| Critical | 76-100 | Full background investigation | Monthly review | Board Level |
