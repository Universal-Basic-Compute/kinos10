# Dispute Resolution Mechanism

# Dispute Resolution Mechanism for FICTRA Platform

## Executive Summary

The FICTRA Dispute Resolution Mechanism (DRM) provides a comprehensive framework for addressing and resolving conflicts that arise within the FICTRA ecosystem. This system is designed to maintain platform integrity, protect participant interests, and ensure the continuous flow of commodity trading transactions while upholding the foundational principles of fairness, transparency, and efficiency.

This document outlines the technical architecture, procedural workflows, governance considerations, and implementation strategy for the DRM. It serves as the authoritative internal reference for the FICTRA development and governance teams responsible for building, maintaining, and evolving this critical platform component.

## 1. Foundational Principles

### 1.1 Core Objectives

The FICTRA Dispute Resolution Mechanism is built on four core objectives:

1. **Maintain Transaction Continuity**: Ensure disputes do not halt the overall functioning of the platform or impede unrelated transactions
2. **Protect Participant Rights**: Safeguard the legitimate interests of all ecosystem participants through fair and impartial processes
3. **Uphold System Integrity**: Preserve the reputation and operational integrity of the FICTRA platform
4. **Minimize Resolution Time**: Resolve disputes efficiently to reduce uncertainty and economic impact

### 1.2 Guiding Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Implementation Consideration |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Neutrality | Resolution processes must remain impartial and free from undue influence | Independent arbitration panel with diverse expertise and rigorous conflict-of-interest protocols |
| Transparency | Process steps, requirements, and outcomes must be clear to all participants | Comprehensive documentation, status tracking, and appropriate disclosure of precedent-setting decisions |
| Proportionality | Response mechanisms should be proportional to the dispute severity and value | Tiered approach with escalation pathways based on quantitative and qualitative assessment criteria |
| Finality | Decisions, once fully adjudicated, must provide conclusive resolution | Limited appeal options with clear criteria and binding final resolutions |
| Accessibility | System must be accessible to all authorized participants regardless of technical sophistication | Intuitive interface design with multiple access channels (portal, API, assisted submission) |
