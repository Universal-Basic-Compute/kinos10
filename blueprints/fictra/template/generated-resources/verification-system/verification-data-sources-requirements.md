# Verification Data Sources & Requirements

# Verification Data Sources & Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive verification framework for FICTRA's dual-token commodity trading system. The verification process serves as the critical bridge between physical commodity delivery and the issuance of Foundation Tokens (FT) to sovereign entities. This system must be robust, secure, transparent, and resistant to tampering while maintaining efficiency for market operations.

Our verification architecture leverages multiple independent data sources through a sophisticated oracle network, implements rigorous validation protocols, and utilizes blockchain technology to create an immutable audit trail. This document details specific data sources, verification requirements, technical specifications, and implementation considerations for the FICTRA development and operations teams.

## 1. Verification System Overview

### 1.1 Core Purpose

The verification system within FICTRA serves several critical functions:

- **Confirming physical delivery** of commodities traded using Payment Tokens
- **Validating export origin** to ensure proper sovereign entity attribution
- **Triggering Foundation Token issuance** to appropriate government entities
- **Creating an immutable record** of verified commodity transactions
- **Preventing fraud** through multi-source verification mechanisms
- **Supporting compliance** with international trade regulations

### 1.2 System Architecture

The verification system employs a three-layer architecture:

| Layer | Components | Primary Function |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Data Collection | Oracle network, API integrations, Manual submission portals | Gather verification data from multiple sources |
| Validation Engine | Smart contracts, Consensus algorithms, Validation rules | Apply verification protocols and determine validity |
| Settlement Layer | Blockchain records, FT issuance mechanism, Transaction logs | Execute token issuance based on validation results |

### 1.3 Verification Workflow

1. **Initiation**: Commodity transaction recorded on blockchain using Payment Tokens
2. **Data Collection**: Verification data gathered from multiple authorized sources
3. **Validation**: Data analyzed against verification protocols and business rules
4. **Consensus**: Multi-source data reconciled to establish verification confidence
5. **Settlement**: Upon successful verification, Foundation Tokens issued to sovereign entity
