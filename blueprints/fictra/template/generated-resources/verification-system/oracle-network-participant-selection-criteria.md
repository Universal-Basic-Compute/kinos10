# Oracle Network Participant Selection Criteria

# Oracle Network Participant Selection Criteria

## Executive Summary

The FICTRA Oracle Network serves as the critical verification backbone for commodity transactions within our dual-token ecosystem. This document establishes comprehensive selection criteria for oracle network participants to ensure the integrity, security, and reliability of our verification system. These criteria have been developed based on industry best practices, specific commodity market requirements, and the unique needs of the FICTRA platform's verification architecture.

Proper oracle participant selection directly impacts the credibility of transaction verification, which in turn affects Foundation Token (FT) allocation to sovereign entities. This document provides the technical and operational framework for identifying, vetting, and onboarding oracle participants while establishing ongoing monitoring mechanisms to maintain network integrity.

## 1. Introduction to Oracle Networks in FICTRA

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

The FICTRA Oracle Network serves as the trusted bridge between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain real-world commodity transaction data. Its primary functions include:

- Verifying physical commodity deliveries
- Validating transaction parameters (quantity, quality, timing)
- Confirming export certification from sovereign entities
- Providing consensus-based confirmation for FT allocation
- Detecting anomalies or fraudulent activities

### 1.2 Technical Architecture Overview

![Oracle Network Architecture](placeholder-for-image)

The FICTRA Oracle Network employs a hybrid architecture with the following components:

- **Node Layer**: Distributed verification nodes operated by selected participants
- **Consensus Layer**: Weighted-verification algorithm for determining validation outcomes
- **Integration Layer**: API connections to commodity verification systems
- **Security Layer**: Cryptographic proof mechanisms and authentication protocols
- **Data Layer**: Standardized data formats for cross-participant compatibility

### 1.3 Impact on Dual-Token System

The Oracle Network directly affects both tokens in the FICTRA ecosystem:

| Token | Oracle Network Impact |
|-------|------------------------|
| Payment Token (PT) | Validates transaction completion to release PT from escrow smart contracts |
| Foundation Token (FT) | Triggers FT allocation to sovereign entities upon verified exports |
