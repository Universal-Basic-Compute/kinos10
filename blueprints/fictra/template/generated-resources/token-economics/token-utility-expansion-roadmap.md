**FT Velocity Considerations**:
- Sovereign reserves program encourages long-term holding
- Enhanced governance rights incentivize maintaining FT positions
- Sovereign swap enhancements create strategic reasons for FT accumulation
- Industry-specific programs create new use cases for FT holdings

**Quantitative Targets**:
- Reduce average PT velocity from current 12 times/year to 8-10 times/year
- Maintain FT velocity below 3 times/year to ensure stability
- Create token holding incentives that lock at least 30% of PT supply
- Establish minimum FT reserves equal to 15% of sovereign commodity exports

#### Network Effect Projections

The utility expansion roadmap is designed to accelerate network effects through strategic sequencing of features:

**Direct Network Effects**:
