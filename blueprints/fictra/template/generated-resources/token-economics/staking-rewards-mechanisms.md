# Staking & Rewards Mechanisms

# Staking & Rewards Mechanisms

## Executive Summary

The FICTRA staking and rewards system creates a robust economic foundation that incentivizes platform participation, enhances token stability, and aligns stakeholder interests. This document outlines the technical architecture, economic models, and strategic considerations for implementing FICTRA's staking and rewards mechanisms across both Payment Tokens (PT) and Foundation Tokens (FT). These mechanisms are essential for creating long-term value, ensuring system stability, and driving adoption among key participants including commodity traders, sovereign entities, and liquidity providers.

> *Note: The staking and rewards mechanisms described in this document work in conjunction with the Dynamic Price Corridor (DPC) detailed in "Dynamic Corridor Approach" and integrate with mechanisms described in "Price Stability Mechanisms," "Treasury Management Strategy," and "Token Burning Policies."*

## 1. Foundation Principles

### 1.1 Core Objectives

The staking and rewards mechanisms within FICTRA are designed to achieve the following objectives:

- **Enhance Token Stability**: Reduce PT price volatility through locked token supply
- **Incentivize Platform Participation**: Reward active engagement from market participants
- **Secure the Network**: Distribute validation responsibilities and promote decentralization
- **Align Stakeholder Interests**: Create shared economic incentives across the ecosystem
- **Bootstrap Liquidity**: Ensure robust trading environments for the Payment Token
- **Support Governance**: Enable stake-weighted voting on system parameters

### 1.2 Stakeholder Groups

Staking and rewards programs are tailored to the needs of different participant groups:

| Stakeholder Group | Definition | Primary Staking Objectives |
|------------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Market Participants | Commodity traders, suppliers, buyers | Reduce trading fees, access premium features, participate in governance |
| Sovereign Entities | Government institutions, central banks | Long-term value accrual, influence governance, optimize token utility |
| Liquidity Providers | Market makers, trading firms | Earn rewards for providing PT liquidity, access rebates |
| Validator Nodes | Technical partners running infrastructure | Earn rewards for securing the verification network |
| Institutional Investors | Strategic token holders, investment funds | Generate yield while supporting system stability |

### 1.3 Token Types and Staking Eligibility

| Token | Stakable? | Key Considerations |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Payment Token (PT) | Yes | Publicly tradable, allows for permissionless staking with flexible durations |
| Foundation Token (FT) | Limited | Sovereign-restricted staking with specialized incentives tied to commodity exports |

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Smart Contract Infrastructure

The staking system is built on Ethereum using a modular contract architecture:

```
StakingManager
├── StakingPool (PT General)
├── StakingPool (PT Validator)
├── StakingPool (PT Liquidity)
├── SovereignStakingPool (FT Sovereign)
├── RewardsCalculator

```

#### 2.1.1 Key Smart Contracts

1. **StakingManager**: Central contract that coordinates staking activities, distribution, and parameter updates
   - Controls stake registration, withdrawal queues, and reward claims
   - Implements emergency functions and security controls
   - Manages pool-specific parameters and global constraints

2. **StakingPool**: Type-specific implementation for different staking categories
   - Tracks individual stake amounts, durations, and reward multipliers
   - Implements stake locking and early withdrawal penalty logic
   - Provides analytics and reporting functions

3. **RewardsCalculator**: Handles complex reward calculation logic
   - Implements various reward formulas based on stake size, duration, and activity
   - Applies multipliers and factors platform metrics into reward determination
   - Processes time-weighted calculations and reward rate adjustments

4. **EmissionsController**: Manages token flow for rewards
   - Controls reward emission schedules and distribution frequency
   - Implements automatic adjustment mechanisms based on system metrics
   - Enforces emission caps and minimum distributions

### 2.2 Technical Implementation Details

#### 2.2.1 Staking Entry Points

```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, uint8 poolType) external {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");
    require(duration >= MIN_STAKE_DURATION, "Duration below minimum");
    require(poolType < POOL_COUNT, "Invalid pool type");
    
    // Transfer tokens from user to contract
    require(paymentToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), 
            "Transfer failed");
    
    // Register stake in appropriate pool
    StakingPool pool = stakingPools[poolType];
    uint256 stakeId = pool.registerStake(msg.sender, amount, duration);
    
    // Update global accounting
    totalStaked += amount;
    userStakes[msg.sender].push(stakeId);
    
    emit StakeCreated(msg.sender, poolType, stakeId, amount, duration);
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Reward Distribution

```solidity
function distributeRewards() external onlyAuthorized {
    // Calculate total rewards to distribute this period
    uint256 periodRewards = emissionsController.calculatePeriodEmission();
    
    // Distribute to each pool according to allocation percentages
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < POOL_COUNT; i++) {
        uint256 poolShare = (periodRewards * poolAllocation[i]) / ALLOCATION_DENOMINATOR;
        stakingPools[i].addRewards(poolShare);
    }
    
    // Update metrics and emission schedule
    lastDistributionTime = block.timestamp;
    emissionsController.recordDistribution(periodRewards);
    
    emit RewardsDistributed(periodRewards);
}
```

#### 2.2.3 Security Measures

- **Time-Locked Withdrawals**: Enforced minimum 24-hour delay between withdrawal request and execution
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic suspension of stake operations during abnormal market conditions
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum staking/unstaking amounts per time period
- **Multisig Controls**: Administrator functions require multiple signature approvals
- **Formal Verification**: Critical staking calculations formally verified for mathematical correctness

### 2.3 Oracle Integration

The rewards system integrates with several oracle networks to align rewards with real-world activities:

1. **Verification Oracle**: Confirms commodity delivery completion
2. **Volume Oracle**: Reports aggregate trading volume on the platform
3. **Price Oracle**: Provides token value references for accurate reward calculations
4. **Activity Oracle**: Tracks user engagement metrics across the platform

## 4. Rewards Calculation Models

### 4.1 Base Reward Formula

The fundamental reward calculation uses a time-weighted staking model:

```
BaseReward = StakeAmount × BaseRate × StakeDuration × DurationMultiplier
```

### 4.2 Enhanced Calculation Models

#### 4.2.1 Volume-Adjusted Rewards

For market participants, rewards are adjusted based on trading activity:

```
AdjustedReward = BaseReward × (1 + (UserVolume / TotalVolume) × VolumeFactor)
```

Where:
- `UserVolume`: The participant's verified trading volume
- `TotalVolume`: Total platform trading volume in the period
- `VolumeFactor`: Configurable parameter (currently 0.5)

#### 4.2.2 Sovereign Export Incentives

For sovereign entities, rewards incorporate export verification:

```
SovereignReward = BaseReward × (1 + (VerifiedExports / PreviousExports) × ExportFactorMultiplier)
```

Where:
- `VerifiedExports`: Total verified exports through FICTRA in the period
- `PreviousExports`: Baseline export level from previous period
- `ExportFactorMultiplier`: Configurable parameter (currently 0.7)

#### 4.2.3 Validator Performance Calculation

```
ValidatorReward = BaseReward × (SuccessfulVerifications / TotalAssignedVerifications) × UptimeMultiplier
```

Where:
- `SuccessfulVerifications`: Correctly processed verification requests
- `TotalAssignedVerifications`: All verification requests assigned to the validator
- `UptimeMultiplier`: Factor based on node availability (range: 0.8-1.2)

### 4.3 Reward Caps and Floors

To ensure system stability and prevent excessive reward concentration:

- **Maximum Reward Cap**: 30% APY under any combination of multipliers
- **Minimum Reward Floor**: 2% APY for any eligible stake meeting minimum requirements
- **Individual Allocation Cap**: No single staker can receive more than 10% of period emissions

## 5. Tokenomics Integration

### 5.1 Emission Schedule

The reward emission schedule follows a predictable declining curve:

| Year | Annual PT Emission for Rewards | % of Total Supply |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| 1    | 50,000,000 PT                 | 5.0%             |
| 2    | 40,000,000 PT                 | 4.0%             |
| 3    | 32,000,000 PT                 | 3.2%             |
| 4    | 25,600,000 PT                 | 2.56%            |
| 5    | 20,480,000 PT                 | 2.05%            |

Sovereign FT rewards follow a separate allocation model tied to verified commodity flows.

### 5.2 Reward Pool Allocation

PT rewards are distributed across different staking pools:

| Pool Type | Allocation % | Justification |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| General Staking | 40% | Incentivize broad token holding and stability |
| Validator Staking | 25% | Secure critical verification infrastructure |
| Liquidity Provider Staking | 30% | Ensure market depth and trading efficiency |
| Community/Ecosystem | 5% | Support adoption initiatives and partnerships |

### 5.3 Dynamic Adjustment Mechanisms

The system incorporates several automatic adjustment mechanisms:

1. **Supply-Based Adjustment**: Emission rates adjust based on the percentage of total token supply staked
   - Target staking range: 30-60% of circulating supply
   - Below 30%: Emission rate increases by up to 20%
   - Above 60%: Emission rate decreases by up to 15%

2. **Utilization-Based Adjustment**: Rewards adjust based on platform transaction volume
   - If volume increases >20% QoQ: Emission rate decreases by 5-10%
   - If volume decreases >20% QoQ: Emission rate increases by 5-10%

3. **Price Volatility Response**: Reward rates adjust during extreme market conditions
   - When price approaches lower corridor boundary:
     - General Staking Pool: +3-5% APY
     - Liquidity Provider Pool: +2-4% APY
     - Validator Pool: +1-2% APY
   - When price approaches upper corridor boundary:
     - General Staking Pool: -2-4% APY
     - Liquidity Provider Pool: -1-3% APY
     - Validator Pool: -1-2% APY

## 6. Strategic Considerations

### 6.1 Market Impact Analysis

The staking and rewards system is designed to significantly impact PT market dynamics:

- **Expected Staking Ratio**: Target of 40-50% of circulating supply staked within first year
- **Liquidity Impact**: Reduction in freely tradable supply by ~45%, potentially increasing price stability
- **Volatility Reduction**: Mathematical models predict 15-25% reduction in average price volatility
- **Price Support Level**: Creates effective price floor through withdrawal lockups and penalties

### 6.2 Competitive Positioning

| Aspect | FICTRA Approach | Typical Crypto Projects | Traditional Finance |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Reward Rates | 3-12% variable | 5-20% declining | 0.5-3% fixed |
| Staking Periods | 30-730 days | 0-365 days | 90+ days |
| Reward Sources | Trading fees + new issuance | Primarily new issuance | Interest bearing only |
| Utility Benefits | Comprehensive fee reductions, governance, and platform benefits | Limited governance only | Minimal extra benefits |
| Stakeholder Alignment | Multiple pools with targeted incentives | One-size-fits-all approach | Limited customization |

### 6.3 Risk Analysis and Mitigation

| Risk Category | Specific Risks | Mitigation Strategies |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Economic | Reward incentives insufficient to drive staking | Dynamic adjustment of rates, added utility benefits |
| | Excessive rewards leading to token inflation | Hard caps on emissions, automatic stabilization |
| Technical | Smart contract vulnerabilities | Formal verification, multiple security audits, limited upgrade capability |
| | Oracle manipulation | Multiple data sources, outlier rejection, time-weighted averages |
| Regulatory | Staking rewards classified as securities | Legal opinion documentation, compliance with jurisdictional requirements |
| | AML/KYC requirements for rewards | Integration with identity verification system |
| Market | Coordinated unstaking leading to price crashes | Time-staggered withdrawals, penalty for early exit |
| | Validator collusion | Random assignment, reputation scoring, minimum validator diversity |

### 6.4 Sovereign Considerations

For sovereign entities, the FT staking mechanism creates several strategic advantages:

1. **Economic Stabilization**: Predictable reward flow helps offset commodity price volatility
2. **Credit Facilitation**: Staked FT serves as collateral for Foundation obligations
3. **Balance Sheet Optimization**: Staking provides yield on otherwise static reserves
4. **Strategic Positioning**: Higher stake levels provide increased influence in governance

### 6.5 Governance Integration

The staking system is tightly coupled with FICTRA's governance architecture:

- **Voting Power**: Calculated as `Stake Amount × Duration Factor × Activity Multiplier`
- **Proposal Rights**: Minimum stake thresholds for submitting governance proposals
- **Parameter Control**: Stake-weighted voting on reward rates, pool allocations, and emission schedules
- **Validator Selection**: Stake influences validator node selection and rotation
