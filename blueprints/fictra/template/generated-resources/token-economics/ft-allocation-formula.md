# FT Allocation Formula

# FT Allocation Formula: Technical Specification and Economic Rationale

## Executive Summary

The Foundation Token (FT) Allocation Formula is a core component of FICTRA's dual-token system, governing how Foundation Tokens are distributed to sovereign governments based on verified commodity exports. This document provides comprehensive technical specifications, economic rationale, implementation considerations, and strategic implications of the formula to guide internal development and governance decision-making.

The formula incorporates multiple variables including commodity type, export volume, market conditions, sustainability factors, and economic development indicators to create a balanced system that incentivizes participation while maintaining economic stability. This document details the mathematical framework, implementation requirements, and governance considerations for effective deployment and management of the FT allocation system.

## 1. Core Formula Structure

### 1.1 Base Allocation Formula

The Foundation Token allocation is determined by the following master formula:

```
FT = PT × [Bm × (1 + Σ(Ai × Wi))]
```

Where:
- **FT** = Foundation Tokens allocated to sovereign government
- **PT** = Payment Token value of verified commodity export
- **Bm** = Base multiplier for the specific commodity category
- **Ai** = Adjustment factor for criterion i
- **Wi** = Weight assigned to criterion i

### 1.2 Base Multiplier (Bm) by Commodity Category

The base multiplier varies by commodity category to reflect strategic importance, market volatility, and long-term sustainability goals:

| Commodity Category | Base Multiplier Range | Current Value | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Energy Resources | 1.2 - 2.0 | 1.5 | Critical economic importance with high strategic value |
| Precious Metals | 1.4 - 2.2 | 1.8 | Store of value, monetary significance, limited reserves |
| Industrial Metals | 1.0 - 1.8 | 1.3 | Essential for manufacturing, technological applications |
| Agricultural Products | 1.3 - 2.1 | 1.7 | Food security importance, sustainability focus |
| Forestry Products | 1.2 - 1.9 | 1.5 | Carbon sequestration value, biodiversity importance |
| Fisheries | 1.1 - 1.8 | 1.4 | Protein source, ecosystem sensitivity |
| Minerals & Raw Materials | 0.9 - 1.7 | 1.2 | Industrial applications, varying scarcity |

### 1.3 Adjustment Factors (Ai)

Adjustment factors modify the base multiplier according to specific criteria that align with FICTRA's economic, environmental, and social objectives:

| Criterion | Range | Variable Type | Calculation Method |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Market Price Volatility | -0.2 to +0.2 | Dynamic | Standard deviation of commodity price over trailing 90 days |
| Supply Chain Sustainability | 0 to +0.3 | Semi-static | Verified certification scores, updated quarterly |
| Transaction Volume | 0 to +0.25 | Dynamic | Logarithmic scaling based on export volume relative to global market |
| Economic Development Index | 0 to +0.4 | Static | Based on UN Human Development Index with annual updates |
| Strategic Resource Status | 0 to +0.5 | Static | Determined by Foundation Council, reviewed bi-annually |
| Carbon Intensity | -0.3 to +0.2 | Semi-static | Verified carbon metrics relative to industry benchmarks |
| Processing Level | 0 to +0.3 | Static | Degree of value-added processing prior to export |

### 1.4 Weighting System (Wi)

Weights determine the relative importance of each adjustment factor in the overall formula:

```
Σ Wi = 1.0
```

Current weight distribution:

| Adjustment Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Market Price Volatility | 0.15 | Price stability incentive mechanism |
| Supply Chain Sustainability | 0.20 | Core ESG alignment with increasing importance |
| Transaction Volume | 0.10 | Scale efficiency with diminishing returns |
| Economic Development Index | 0.25 | Primary development incentive mechanism |
| Strategic Resource Status | 0.15 | Global supply security consideration |
| Carbon Intensity | 0.10 | Climate alignment with moderate influence |
| Processing Level | 0.05 | Value-added incentive with limited weight |

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Data Sources and Verification

The formula requires reliable data from multiple sources:

| Data Category | Source | Update Frequency | Verification Method |
|---------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Commodity Pricing | Bloomberg, Reuters, specialized commodity exchanges | Daily | Multi-source consensus algorithm |
| Export Volume | Customs declarations, bills of lading, shipping manifests | Per transaction | Oracle network with cross-reference verification |
| Sustainability Certifications | Third-party certification bodies (e.g., FSC, MSC, Rainforest Alliance) | Quarterly | Certificate validation API with blockchain record |
| Economic Indicators | World Bank, IMF, United Nations databases | Annual | Direct data integration with cryptographic verification |
| Carbon Metrics | Specialized carbon accounting services, industry reports | Quarterly | Third-party verification with staked validation |
| Processing Level | Customs classification codes, product specifications | Per transaction | Smart contract verification of HS codes |

### 2.2 Oracle Network Architecture

The oracle network provides reliable data feeds for the dynamic components of the formula:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Primary Oracle  │     │ Secondary Oracle│     │ Tertiary Oracle │
│ Network         │────▶│ Network         │────▶│ Network         │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Consensus Mechanism                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Allocation Smart Contract                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Specific considerations:
- Minimum of 7 independent data sources for each critical data point
- 2/3 majority required for consensus on verification
- Time-weighted averaging for highly volatile metrics
- Failsafe mechanisms with default values if oracle consensus cannot be reached
- Cryptographic proof of data provenance

### 2.3 Smart Contract Implementation

The allocation formula is implemented through a series of smart contracts:

1. **Data Ingestion Contract**
   - Receives verified data from oracle network
   - Validates data format and range
   - Stores in temporary contract storage

2. **Calculation Contract**
   - Retrieves verified data
   - Applies formula components
   - Computes final FT allocation

3. **Allocation Contract**
   - Receives calculation result
   - Verifies against safety parameters
   - Initiates token minting and distribution

4. **Audit Trail Contract**
   - Records all allocation decisions
   - Maintains cryptographic proof of calculation
   - Provides verification endpoint for sovereign entities

### 2.4 Circuit Breakers and Safety Mechanisms

To prevent erroneous allocations or system exploitation:

- **Maximum Allocation Cap**: No single allocation can exceed 5% of total FT supply
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 20% increase in allocation compared to trailing 30-day average
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatic freeze of allocations that deviate >35% from expected values
- **Manual Override**: Foundation Council multi-signature required for emergency interventions
- **Gradual Release**: Large allocations are distributed over time rather than instantly

## 3. Economic Models and Simulations

### 3.1 Impact on Token Supply Dynamics

The allocation formula directly affects the growth rate of FT supply:

| Scenario | Annual FT Supply Growth | PT/FT Value Relationship | Economic Impact |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Base Case | 12-15% | Gradual PT appreciation | Sustainable ecosystem growth |
| High Commodity Prices | 18-22% | Potential PT volatility | Requires active stabilization |
| Low Commodity Prices | 5-8% | PT value stabilization | Reduced sovereign benefits |
| Sustainability Premium Scenario | 14-17% | Enhanced PT stability | Aligned with ESG objectives |
| Concentrated Export Pattern | 10-12% with high concentration | Geopolitical risk to PT | Requires sovereign diversification |

### 3.2 Elasticity Factors

The formula incorporates elasticity considerations to adapt to market conditions:

1. **Price Elasticity Modifier**
   - Reduces multiplier during extreme price increases
   - Formula: `Em = 1 - max(0, (Pc/Pb - 1) × 0.5)`
   - Where `Pc` = current price, `Pb` = baseline price (90-day moving average)

2. **Supply Response Dampener**
   - Prevents allocation spikes during supply shocks
   - Activates when global supply decreases >10% in 30 days
   - Reduces allocation by factor of 0.7-0.9 depending on severity

3. **Market Sentiment Corrector**
   - Utilizes machine learning to detect speculative bubbles
   - Adjusts base multiplier when speculative activity exceeds predetermined thresholds
   - Requires Foundation Council approval for activation

### 3.3 Monte Carlo Simulation Results

Our economic modeling team conducted 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the formula under various market conditions:

| Key Performance Indicator | 10th Percentile | Median | 90th Percentile |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Annual FT Supply Growth | 7.8% | 13.5% | 19.2% |
| FT/PT Ratio Stability | 0.85 | 0.93 | 0.97 |
| Sovereign Participation Rate | 82% | 94% | 98% |
| System Gaming Attempts | 2.1% | 4.3% | 7.8% |
| Allocation Formula Adjustments | 1 | 2 | 4 |

Simulation conclusions:
- Formula demonstrates robust stability under 92% of tested scenarios
- Most vulnerable to coordinated market manipulation during extreme commodity price volatility
- Sovereign feedback mechanism creates self-stabilizing properties in 78% of scenarios
- Economic development weighting shows highest impact on long-term system stability

## 4. Governance Framework
