# Token Burning Policies

# Token Burning Policies

## Executive Summary

This document outlines FICTRA's token burning policies for both the Payment Token (PT) and Foundation Token (FT) within our dual-token ecosystem. Token burning—the permanent removal of tokens from circulation—plays a critical role in maintaining system integrity, controlling inflation, and creating long-term value stability. The policies described here are designed to support FICTRA's mission of revolutionizing global commodity trading while ensuring sustainable tokenomics.

> *Note: The token burning mechanisms described in this document are integrated with the Dynamic Price Corridor (DPC) detailed in "Dynamic Corridor Approach" and work in conjunction with mechanisms described in "Price Stability Mechanisms," "Treasury Management Strategy," and "Staking & Rewards Mechanisms."*

## 1. Introduction to Token Burning

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

Token burning is the process by which tokens are permanently removed from the circulating supply by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address (a "burn address"). Once tokens are sent to this address, they cannot be recovered or used again, effectively removing them from circulation.

For FICTRA, token burning serves several critical functions:

- **Supply Control**: Manages token inflation and maintains scarcity
- **Value Preservation**: Creates deflationary pressure to support token value
- **System Stability**: Provides mechanisms to absorb excess liquidity
- **Market Confidence**: Demonstrates commitment to long-term token sustainability
- **Economic Balance**: Maintains equilibrium between PT and FT ecosystems

### 1.2 Significance in FICTRA's Dual-Token System

Unlike single-token cryptocurrencies, FICTRA's dual-token system requires specialized burning policies that account for the interdependent relationship between PTs and FTs:

- **Payment Tokens (PT)**: Publicly traded, requiring market-responsive burning mechanisms
- **Foundation Tokens (FT)**: Limited to sovereign entities, requiring governance-driven burning protocols

The burning policies must maintain the delicate balance between these two token ecosystems while supporting their distinct functions in commodity trading.

## 2. Burning Mechanisms for Payment Tokens (PT)

### 2.1 Automated Burning Mechanisms

#### 2.1.1 Transaction Fee Burning

A percentage of transaction fees collected on the FICTRA platform will be automatically burned according to the following structure:

**Launch Phase Price Stability (First 60 Days)**:

| Price Range | Liquidity Allocation | Fee Structure | Burn Rate |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| $0.98-$0.99 | Enhanced buy-side AMM | 0.1% fee, 80% to reserves | 5% |
| $0.99-$1.01 | Balanced Curve-style | 0.1% fee, split equally | 10% |
| $1.01-$1.02 | Enhanced sell-side AMM | 0.1% fee, 80% to burn | 15% |
| Outside Range | Circuit breakers active | 0.2% fee + reversion incentives | 20% |

**Dynamic Burn Rate Adjustments**:

When price approaches upper corridor boundary:
- Transaction fee burns: Increase by 25-50% above standard rates
- Algorithmic burns: Accelerate schedule by 30-60 days
- Buyback and burn: Increase quarterly allocation by 3-5%

When price approaches lower corridor boundary:
- Transaction fee burns: Decrease by 25-50% below standard rates
- Algorithmic burns: Delay schedule by 30-60 days
- Buyback and burn: Decrease quarterly allocation by 3-5%

**Standard Burn Rates (After 60 Days)**:

| Transaction Volume (Monthly) | Percentage of Fees Burned |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| < 1 million PT               | 10%                       |
| 1-10 million PT              | 15%                       |
| 10-50 million PT             | 20%                       |
| > 50 million PT              | 25%                       |

**Implementation Details**:
- Burn events occur automatically at the end of each calendar month
- Smart contracts calculate the appropriate amount based on volume tiers
- Execution is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain
- Monthly burn reports are published in the FICTRA analytics dashboard

#### 2.1.2 Volume-Based Burning

Based on total PT trading volume, additional tokens will be burned according to preset thresholds:

| Quarterly Trading Volume | Additional PT Burned |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| > 100 million PT         | 50,000 PT            |
| > 500 million PT         | 150,000 PT           |
| > 1 billion PT           | 300,000 PT           |
| > 5 billion PT           | 750,000 PT           |

**Technical Implementation**:
```solidity
// Simplified example of volume-based burning function
function executeVolumeBurn(uint256 quarterlyVolume) external onlyAuthorized {
    require(block.timestamp >= nextBurnTime, "Too early for burn event");
    
    uint256 burnAmount = 0;
    if (quarterlyVolume > 5_000_000_000 * (10**18)) {
        burnAmount = 750_000 * (10**18);
    } else if (quarterlyVolume > 1_000_000_000 * (10**18)) {
        burnAmount = 300_000 * (10**18);
    } else if (quarterlyVolume > 500_000_000 * (10**18)) {
        burnAmount = 150_000 * (10**18);
    } else if (quarterlyVolume > 100_000_000 * (10**18)) {
        burnAmount = 50_000 * (10**18);
    }
    
    if (burnAmount > 0) {
        require(token.balanceOf(treasuryAddress) >= burnAmount, "Insufficient treasury balance");
        token.transferFrom(treasuryAddress, burnAddress, burnAmount);
        emit VolumeBurn(burnAmount, quarterlyVolume);
    }
    
    nextBurnTime = block.timestamp + 90 days;
}
```

### 2.2 Algorithmic Burning

#### 2.2.1 Market Stability Protocol

An algorithmic burning mechanism will be implemented to respond to specific market conditions:

- **Trigger Conditions**: Activated when PT volatility exceeds predefined thresholds
- **Calculation Formula**: `Burn Amount = Base Burn × Volatility Multiplier × Supply Factor`
  
  Where:
  - Base Burn: Fixed amount (25,000 PT)
  - Volatility Multiplier: Ranges from 1.0 to 3.0 based on 30-day volatility metrics
  - Supply Factor: Adjustment based on current circulating supply relative to target supply

- **Frequency Limits**: Maximum of one algorithmic burn event per 14-day period
- **Execution Method**: Implemented through secure oracle-driven smart contracts

#### 2.2.2 Supply-Demand Balancing

To maintain optimal token velocity and market depth:

- **Monitoring Metrics**:
  - Token velocity (average transaction frequency)
  - Market depth on exchanges
  - Price stability indicators
  - Trading volume relative to market cap

- **Balancing Actions**:
  - When velocity exceeds target: Increase burn rate by 5-15%
  - When market depth falls below threshold: Execute supplementary burns
  - When price stability deteriorates: Implement stabilization burns

### 2.3 Strategic Burning Events

#### 2.3.1 Buyback and Burn

FICTRA will allocate a portion of platform revenue to a buyback and burn program:

- **Budget Allocation**: 7-12% of quarterly revenue, adjusted based on market conditions
- **Execution Strategy**: 
  - Gradual purchases to minimize market impact
  - Purchases distributed across multiple exchanges
  - Transparent disclosure of buyback activities
  - Immediate burning of acquired tokens

- **Decision Framework**:

| Market Condition | Buyback Budget | Purchase Strategy                | Upper Corridor Adjustment |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Bull Market              | 7%             | Gradual, evenly distributed      | +3-5% allocation |
| Neutral Market           | 10%            | Opportunistic, volatility-focused| No adjustment |
| Bear Market              | 12%            | Aggressive, concentrated         | No adjustment |

#### 2.3.2 Milestone Burns

Predetermined burning events tied to platform growth milestones:

- **New Market Expansion**: 100,000 PT burn when entering new geographic regions
- **Exchange Listings**: 50,000 PT burn for each major exchange listing
- **Volume Milestones**: 250,000 PT burn when reaching key cumulative volume thresholds
- **User Adoption**: 75,000 PT burn for every 10,000 new verified users

**Launch Implementation Schedule**:
```
Month 1: Private sale participant onboarding and KYC
Month 2: Strategic round allocation and integration
Month 3: Public sale preparation and exchange coordination
Launch: Coordinated exchange listings at $1.00 with:
- Curve-style USD/ETH liquidity pools around $1.00
- Market maker incentives for $0.98-$1.02 range
- Circuit breakers beyond ±2% in first 48 hours
- Rolling liquidity windows that adjust with price movement
```

## 3. Burning Policies for Foundation Tokens (FT)

### 3.1 Sovereign Transaction Burns

When sovereign entities convert FT to PT or use FT for direct commodity purchases, a portion will be burned:

- **Standard Conversion**: 3% of FT is burned during conversion to PT
- **Commodity Purchases**: 1.5% of FT is burned during direct commodity acquisitions
- **Sovereign Swaps**: 2% of FT value is burned during sovereign-to-sovereign token exchanges

**Technical Implementation Notes**:
- Burns occur at the transaction layer via smart contract
- Sovereign entities receive clear documentation of burn events
- Cumulative burn metrics are provided in sovereign dashboards
- Exclusions may apply for humanitarian or emergency transactions

### 3.2 Governance-Driven Burns

FICTRA's Sovereign Committee will have authority to propose and approve specialized burning events:

- **Quarterly Evaluation**: Assessment of FT monetary policy needs
- **Voting Mechanism**: Weighted voting based on sovereign participation levels
- **Implementation Threshold**: 67% approval required for execution
- **Maximum Burn Limits**: 1.5% of circulating FT per quarter

**Governance Process Workflow**:
1. Economic analysis and burn proposal preparation
2. Preliminary review by Foundation Council
3. Formal proposal submission to Sovereign Committee
4. 14-day deliberation period
5. Voting period (5 days)
6. Technical implementation if approved
7. Verification and reporting

### 3.3 Sustainability and Balance Mechanisms

#### 3.3.1 FT-PT Ratio Management

To maintain the strategic balance between the FT and PT ecosystems:

- **Target Ratio**: Optimal FT:PT value ratio of 2.5:1 to 3.5:1
- **Monitoring Metrics**: 
  - Total FT value relative to PT market capitalization
  - FT issuance rate vs. PT trading volume
  - Conversion patterns between tokens

- **Balancing Actions**:
  - When ratio exceeds 3.5:1: Increase FT burn rates by 0.5-1.5%
  - When ratio falls below 2.5:1: Reduce FT burn rates by 0.5-1.0%
  - Extreme imbalance (>4:1 or <2:1): Emergency Sovereign Committee meeting

#### 3.3.2 Economic Stability Mechanism

Special burning protocols to maintain FT economic stability:

- **Inflation Control**: Burn rate adjustment based on commodity price inflation
- **Validation Cycle**: Monthly economic analysis and quarterly adjustment
- **Implementation Method**: Gradual adjustment to minimize market disruption

| Commodity Inflation Rate | FT Burn Rate Adjustment |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| < 1%                     | -0.5%                   |
| 1-3%                     | No change               |
| 3-7%                     | +0.5%                   |
| > 7%                     | +1.0%                   |

## 4. Technical Implementation

    }
    
    // Additional functions omitted for brevity
}
```

#### 4.2.2 FT Burning Implementation

```solidity
// FT Burning Smart Contract (simplified example)
contract FTBurner is Ownable {
    IERC20 public foundationToken;
    address public constant BURN_ADDRESS = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;
    
    event FTBurned(uint256 amount, string burnType, address sovereignEntity);
    
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedSovereignEntities;
    
    constructor(address _foundationToken) {
        foundationToken = IERC20(_foundationToken);
    }
    
    // For sovereign transaction burns
    function burnFromConversion(uint256 convertAmount) external onlySovereign {
        uint256 burnAmount = convertAmount * 3 / 100; // 3% burn rate
