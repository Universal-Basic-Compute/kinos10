       function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
           require(sovereignEntities[msg.sender], "Only sovereign entities can transfer");
           require(sovereignEntities[recipient] || isAuthorizedConverter(recipient), 
                   "Recipient must be sovereign or authorized converter");
           
           // Apply sovereign transfer policies
           require(validateSovereignTransfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount), 
                   "Transfer violates sovereign policies");
           
           return super.transfer(recipient, amount);
       }

       // PT holder rights tiers based on holdings and activity
       enum PTTier { Standard, Premium, Institutional, MarketMaker }
       
       // Track user rights and tiers
       mapping(address => PTTier) public ptHolderTier;
       mapping(address => bool) public sovereignEntities;
       
       // Rights enforcement for specific actions
       function enforceTransactionRights(address user, bytes4 functionSig) public view returns (bool) {
           // Check if user has rights for the specific function
           return hasRight(user, functionSig);
       }
       
       // Rights assignment based on holdings and verification
       function updateUserTier(address user) public {
           uint256 holdings = getTokenHoldings(user);
           uint256 activity = getUserActivity(user);
           
           // Determine appropriate tier
           ptHolderTier[user] = calculateTier(holdings, activity);
