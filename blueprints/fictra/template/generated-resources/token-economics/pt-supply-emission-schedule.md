# PT Supply & Emission Schedule

# PT Supply & Emission Schedule

## Executive Summary

The Payment Token (PT) supply and emission schedule forms a critical foundation of the FICTRA ecosystem. This document outlines the comprehensive framework for PT issuance, distribution, and management throughout the platform's lifecycle. The schedule is designed to balance market liquidity, price stability, and long-term ecosystem development while aligning with FICTRA's mission to transform global commodity trading.

> *Note: The emission schedule described in this document is designed to support the Dynamic Price Corridor (DPC) detailed in "Dynamic Corridor Approach" and works in conjunction with mechanisms described in "Price Stability Mechanisms," "Treasury Management Strategy," "Token Burning Policies," and "Staking & Rewards Mechanisms."*

The total PT supply is capped at 500 million tokens, released through a strategic multi-phase emission schedule spanning 10 years. This controlled release mechanism incorporates adaptive parameters to respond to market conditions, trading volumes, and ecosystem development milestones. The schedule reflects our commitment to creating a sustainable token economy that supports both early adoption and long-term platform stability.

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

The PT emission schedule is implemented through a series of smart contracts that ensure transparent, secure, and autonomous token distribution.

#### Core Contract Components

1. **TimelockController**: Enforces vesting schedules with secure time-based release mechanisms
   ```solidity
   contract PTTimelock is TimelockController {
       // Custom implementation for PT release schedules
       function scheduleRelease(
           address target,
           uint256 amount,
           bytes32 releaseId,
           uint256 releaseTime
       ) external onlyRole(SCHEDULER_ROLE) { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **EmissionScheduler**: Coordinates token releases according to the schedule
   ```solidity
   contract EmissionScheduler {
       // Release schedule management
       mapping(uint256 => Release) public releases;
       struct Release {
           uint256 amount;
           uint256 scheduledTime;
           bool executed;
           bool cancelled;
           ReleaseCondition[] conditions;
       }
       // Additional implementation details...
   }
   ```

3. **VestingVault**: Manages team and advisor token allocations with cliff and vesting periods
   ```solidity
   contract VestingVault {
       // Vesting schedule implementation
       mapping(address => VestingSchedule) public vestingSchedules;
       struct VestingSchedule {
           uint256 totalAmount;
           uint256 cliffDuration;
           uint256 vestingDuration;
           uint256 vestingStartTime;
           uint256 claimed;
       }
       // Additional implementation details...
   }
   ```

4. **MarketResponseModule**: Monitors market conditions and triggers adaptive mechanisms
   ```solidity
   contract MarketResponseModule {
       // Oracle integration for price and volume data
       function checkTriggerConditions() external returns (bool triggered, ActionType action) { ... }
       // Trigger-specific implementations...
   }
   ```

#### Oracles & External Dependencies

The emission system relies on the following external data sources:

1. **Price Oracles**: Chainlink price feeds for PT/USD data
2. **Volume Oracles**: Custom oracle implementation for trading volume data
3. **Platform Metrics Oracle**: Internal FICTRA metrics API integration
4. **Multisig Authorization**: Gnosis Safe for high-security operations

### Deployment & Operational Workflow

The release process follows this operational workflow:

1. **Scheduled Evaluation**: 7 days before scheduled release, conditions are evaluated
2. **Council Review**: 5 days before release, council reviews and approves/modifies
3. **Technical Preparation**: 3 days before release, technical team prepares execution
4. **Announcement**: 48 hours before release, public announcement is made
5. **Execution**: Release is executed via timelocked transaction
6. **Verification**: Post-release audit confirms correct distribution
7. **Market Monitoring**: 72-hour intensive monitoring period follows each release

---

## Strategic Considerations

### Market Impact Management

#### Price Stability Measures

To prevent excessive volatility during token releases, the following measures are implemented:

1. **Graduated Release**: Large allocations are split into smaller tranches released over 48-72 hours
2. **Market Maker Coordination**: Advance notice to contracted market makers to adjust strategies
3. **Liquidity Bootstrapping**: Temporary liquidity provision during release events
4. **Release Timing**: Scheduled during periods of expected lower market activity

#### Public Communication Strategy

For each release phase, a comprehensive communication plan includes:

1. **Advance Notification**: 14-day general notice, 7-day detailed parameters
2. **Transparency Reports**: Post-release reports detailing actual distribution
3. **Market Context**: Providing ecosystem context for scheduled releases
4. **Expectation Management**: Clear guidance on intended market operations

### Alignment with Foundation Token (FT) System

The PT emission schedule is strategically aligned with the Foundation Token (FT) system to ensure complementary operations:

| PT Release Event | FT System Alignment |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Strategic Partner Allocations | Corresponds with new sovereign entity onboarding |
| Ecosystem Development Grants | Aligns with verification system expansion |
| Public Sale Distributions | Timed with FT sovereign redemption windows |
| Market Operations Releases | Coordinated with expected FT conversion activities |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Concentration Risk

To prevent excessive token concentration:

1. **Maximum Allocation Caps**: No single entity can acquire more than 5% of public sale
2. **Distribution Metrics Monitoring**: Ongoing analysis of token distribution Gini coefficient
3. **Strategic Reserve Deployment**: Corrective distributions if concentration exceeds thresholds

#### Market Manipulation Prevention

Safeguards against market manipulation include:

1. **Release Segmentation**: Large releases divided into multiple smaller tranches
2. **Anti-Wash Trading Monitoring**: Partnership with chain analysis firms
3. **Abnormal Activity Triggers**: Automated alerts for suspicious trading patterns
4. **Exchange Coordination**: Collaborative monitoring with listing partners

#### Regulatory Compliance

The emission schedule incorporates regulatory considerations:

1. **Jurisdictional Analysis**: Pre-release legal review for relevant jurisdictions
2. **Regulatory Reporting**: Required filings and notifications
3. **Compliance Documentation**: Detailed records of distribution decisions
4. **Rapid Response Protocol**: Mechanism to pause distributions if regulatory concerns arise

## Conclusion

The PT Supply & Emission Schedule establishes a robust framework for the controlled distribution of Payment Tokens, balancing immediate market needs with long-term ecosystem health. This schedule is designed to optimize for four primary objectives:

1. **Market Stability**: Preventing excessive volatility through controlled, predictable releases
2. **Ecosystem Development**: Aligning token distribution with platform growth and adoption
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensuring all participants have appropriate incentives and vesting
4. **Adaptive Responsiveness**: Building in mechanisms to adjust to changing market conditions

Through careful implementation of this schedule, FICTRA will establish PT as a stable, utility-focused token for commodity market transactions while creating a sustainable foundation for long-term ecosystem growth. The schedule's built-in governance mechanisms ensure that the system can evolve as the platform matures, responding to market feedback and changing conditions while maintaining core principles of transparency and stability.

Regular monitoring and assessment will be critical to the successful implementation of this emission schedule, with the framework designed to incorporate learning and adaptation throughout the multi-year distribution process.
