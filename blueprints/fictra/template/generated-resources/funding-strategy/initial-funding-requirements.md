# Initial Funding Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines FICTRA's initial funding requirements to establish the foundation for our dual-token cryptocurrency system for commodity trading. With a focused approach on essential development and operational needs, we require $2 million in seed funding to build our core technology, establish our legal framework, and begin sovereign and market participant engagement.

This seed funding will enable FICTRA to develop a minimum viable platform, secure necessary legal foundations, and create the relationships required for a successful launch. Our capital-efficient approach prioritizes critical path development while establishing the groundwork for future expansion and liquidity provision through subsequent funding rounds.

## 1. Seed Funding Philosophy

### 1.1 Capital Efficiency Principles

FICTRA's approach to initial funding is guided by several core principles:

- **Essential First**: Focus resources on critical path components necessary for demonstrating platform viability
- **Lean Development**: Utilize small, highly skilled teams working on core functionality
- **Strategic Sequencing**: Prioritize development that unlocks key technical and market validation
- **Regulatory Foundation**: Establish minimum viable compliance framework in our primary jurisdiction
- **Relationship Building**: Initiate critical sovereign and market relationships that will drive adoption

### 1.2 Funding Objectives

The $2 million seed funding will enable FICTRA to:

1. Develop core smart contract architecture and basic platform functionality
2. Establish legal foundation as a Swiss entity with initial regulatory framework
3. Build relationships with 2-3 potential sovereign participants
4. Create technical documentation and economic model validation
5. Assemble a small, high-impact core team to execute the initial roadmap
6. Prepare for subsequent funding to support full development and launch
