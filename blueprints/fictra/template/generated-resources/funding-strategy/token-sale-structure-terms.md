# Token Sale Structure & Terms

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive token sale strategy for the FICTRA (Foundation for the Improvement of Commodity Trading) dual-token ecosystem. The token sale has been structured to ensure optimal distribution, market stability, and alignment with FICTRA's long-term vision of revolutionizing global commodity markets. The payment token (PT) sale is designed to accomplish multiple strategic objectives, including generating necessary development funding, establishing initial market liquidity, and creating appropriate token distribution among key stakeholders in the commodity trading ecosystem.

The token sale employs a multi-phase approach with varying pricing tiers and allocation strategies to different participant categories. This approach balances the need for early strategic partnerships with broader market participation while implementing robust mechanisms to prevent market manipulation and ensure long-term stability. The following document details the complete structure, terms, vesting schedules, compliance mechanisms, and strategic considerations for the FICTRA token sale.

## Token Sale Overview

### Dual-Token System Context

Before detailing the sale structure, it's essential to understand how the token sale fits within FICTRA's dual-token ecosystem:

1. **Payment Token (PT)**:
   - Publicly traded cryptocurrency used for commodity contract denomination
   - Primary focus of the token sale
   - Will be available on exchanges after the sale phases conclude
   - Value derives from utility in commodity trading and broader market dynamics

2. **Foundation Token (FT)**:
   - Not part of the public token sale
   - Allocated to sovereign governments based on verified exports
   - Controlled-distribution token with strategic economic functions
   - Relationship with PT creates unique value dynamics that influence PT valuation

### Token Sale Objectives

The PT token sale is structured to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Capital Formation**: Generate sufficient funding for platform development, infrastructure deployment, and operational runway
2. **Strategic Allocation**: Distribute tokens to participants who will actively use and contribute to the ecosystem
3. **Market Stability**: Create mechanisms that prevent excessive speculation and volatility
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Ensure broad global participation aligned with commodity trading markets
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to relevant securities and cryptocurrency regulations in target jurisdictions
6. **Sovereignty Alignment**: Structure participation to accommodate government endorsement and participation

## Token Economics
