# FICTRA Memory System

## Overview

The FICTRA Memory System provides a structured approach to managing knowledge, tracking website changes, and maintaining system architecture documentation. This system ensures that AI-generated content is preserved during deployments while maintaining a clear separation between templates and generated content.

## System Structure

The memory system is organized into four main sections:

1. **System** - Core architecture, economic models, implementation details, and knowledge base
2. **Website** - Website structure, content management, component documentation, and deployment tracking
3. **Interactions** - User questions, collaboration sessions, and feedback management
4. **Resources** - External references, templates, and asset management

## Usage Guidelines

- **README Files**: Contain persistent documentation that won't be overwritten during deployments
- **JSON Files**: Store structured data that needs to be machine-readable
- **Content Updates**: Track changes in dedicated files rather than modifying templates directly
- **Deployment Process**: Follow documented procedures to prevent content overwrites

## Maintenance Procedures

1. Update relevant README files when making significant changes to system architecture or processes
2. Keep JSON files current with the latest structured data
3. Document all website content updates in the appropriate tracking files
4. Review and update the memory system regularly to ensure it reflects the current state of FICTRA

## Integration with Website

The memory system is designed to work seamlessly with the FICTRA website by:

- Documenting component structure and dependencies
- Tracking content updates separately from templates
- Maintaining clear procedures for content management
- Establishing relationships between memory components and website elements

This integrated approach ensures that the website accurately reflects FICTRA's capabilities while preserving AI-generated content during the development process.
