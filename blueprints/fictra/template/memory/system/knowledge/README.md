## Core Concepts

### Dual-Token System

FICTRA's foundation is its innovative dual-token architecture:

1. **Payment Token (PT)**
   - Used for commodity transactions
   - Market-determined value with stability mechanisms
   - Designed to reduce volatility while maintaining efficiency
   - Primary medium of exchange within the ecosystem

2. **Foundation Token (FT)**
   - Allocated to sovereign entities based on verified exports
   - Creates additional value stream for commodity-producing nations
   - Potential use as foreign exchange reserves
   - Enables sovereign participation in governance

### Verification System

The verification system ensures the integrity of commodity transactions:

- **Oracle Network** - Distributed system for validating physical deliveries
- **Multi-source Verification** - Cross-referencing multiple data sources
- **Automated Triggers** - Smart contract execution based on verification
- **Dispute Resolution** - Mechanisms for addressing verification challenges
