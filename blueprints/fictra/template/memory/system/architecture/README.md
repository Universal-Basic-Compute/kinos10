# FICTRA Core Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the fundamental architecture of the FICTRA dual-token system, including its key components, their relationships, and the technical principles that govern the system's operation. The architecture is designed to support FICTRA's mission of decoupling commodity trading from USD fluctuations while creating additional value for sovereign entities.

## Core Components

### 1. Dual-Token System

The foundation of FICTRA is its innovative dual-token architecture:

- **Payment Token (PT)** - Used for commodity transactions with stability mechanisms
- **Foundation Token (FT)** - Allocated to sovereign entities based on verified exports

The relationship between these tokens creates FICTRA's unique value proposition and economic model.

### 2. Verification System

The verification system ensures the integrity of commodity transactions:

- Oracle network for validating physical deliveries
- Multi-source data verification protocols
- Automated verification triggers for token allocation
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

### 3. Smart Contract Framework

FICTRA's functionality is implemented through a sophisticated smart contract system:

- Token issuance and management contracts
- Verification and allocation logic
- Conversion mechanisms between token types
- Stability control algorithms

### 4. Governance Structure

The system is governed through a multi-layered approach:

- Foundation Council for strategic oversight
- Technical Committee for implementation decisions
- Economic Committee for monetary policy
- Sovereign Committee for participating government input

## Technical Principles

1. **Security by Design** - Multiple security layers with formal verification
2. **Scalability** - Architecture designed to handle global commodity trading volumes
3. **Interoperability** - Standards-based approach for integration with existing systems
4. **Privacy** - Balanced transparency with appropriate data protection
5. **Resilience** - Fault-tolerant design with no single points of failure

## Component Relationships

The components.json file maintains a registry of system components and their relationships, providing a machine-readable representation of the system architecture.

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Update this documentation when making architectural changes
- Ensure consistency between documentation and implementation
- Review architecture quarterly for potential improvements
- Validate that all components align with FICTRA's core principles

This architecture documentation serves as the definitive reference for FICTRA's design and provides the foundation for all system development.
