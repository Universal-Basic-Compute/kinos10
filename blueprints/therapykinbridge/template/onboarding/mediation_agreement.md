- Progress review process
- Completion or transition guidelines

### Specialized Protocols

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Review agreement components with all participants
2. Discuss and customize to relationship-specific needs
3. Clarify questions and concerns
4. Establish mutual understanding of expectations
5. Create written or recorded version of agreement
6. Reference agreement when process questions arise
7. Review and adjust agreement as mediation progresses
8. Use as foundation for establishing psychological safety

## Example Agreement Elements

### Participation Statement
"We agree to participate in the mediation process with openness and good faith effort. This includes attending scheduled sessions, engaging in suggested practices between sessions, and providing honest feedback about the process. If participation becomes difficult, we agree to discuss concerns directly rather than withdrawing without explanation."

### Confidentiality Statement
"Information shared in individual sessions will remain confidential unless specific permission is given to share it. Observations about patterns and dynamics may be shared without attributing them to specific disclosures. Either participant may request that certain information remain private, and these boundaries will be respected."

### Communication Guideline
"During mediation sessions, we agree to practice taking turns speaking, listening without interrupting, and using 'I' statements rather than accusations. If conversations become too heated, either person can request a 5-minute break to regain composure before continuing."

### Process Expectation
"The mediation process will typically include a combination of individual and joint sessions. We'll begin with assessment, establish shared goals, and then work on specific relationship challenges. We'll review progress regularly and adjust our approach based on what's working well."

## Customization Areas

The agreement should be adapted based on:
- Relationship type and context
- Specific challenges and concerns
- Cultural considerations
- Individual comfort with process
- Previous relationship intervention experiences
- Particular sensitivities or boundaries
- Communication preferences and capabilities

## Documentation Approach

The final agreement should be:
- Clearly articulated in accessible language
- Available to all participants for reference
- Specific enough to provide guidance
- Flexible enough to adapt as needed
- Reviewed periodically throughout the process
- Stored in the bridge memory system
