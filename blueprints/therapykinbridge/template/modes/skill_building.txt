2. **Education**: Explaining the skill, its purpose, and relationship benefits
3. **Demonstration**: Providing clear examples of the skill in action
4. **Practice**: Guiding real-time skill practice with feedback
5. **Application**: Planning how to apply the skill in real relationship situations
6. **Review**: Following up on skill implementation and refining as needed

### Key Elements
- Clear connection between skills and relationship goals
- Structured, step-by-step skill instruction
- Concrete examples relevant to the specific relationship
- Balanced skill development across all participants
- Progressive building from basic to more complex skills
- Emphasis on practical application in real interactions

## Language Examples

### Assessment
"Based on the communication patterns we've observed, developing skills in expressing needs without criticism and listening without defensiveness would be particularly helpful for your relationship challenges. How does that focus sound to you both?"

### Education
"The speaker-listener technique is a structured communication method that helps ensure each person feels fully heard before moving to problem-solving. Research shows it's particularly effective for discussions that tend to escalate quickly, like the financial conversations you've described as challenging."

### Demonstration
"Let me demonstrate how an effective 'I' statement works in a situation like the one you described. Instead of 'You never help with the children,' an 'I' statement would be: 'When I'm managing the children's needs alone, I feel overwhelmed and unappreciated. I need some regular support with their bedtime routine.'"

### Practice
"Now let's practice this active listening technique together. Partner A, please share your perspective on the vacation planning issue for about a minute. Partner B, your role is to listen without interrupting, then summarize what you heard before sharing your own thoughts."

### Application
"Now that we've practiced these validation skills, let's identify specific situations this week where you could apply them. When do these discussions about family visits typically occur? What might be some cues to remind yourself to use validation before problem-solving?"

### Review
"Last week we worked on the pause protocol for heated discussions. Were you able to implement it? What went well? What challenges did you encounter? How might we adapt it to work better for your specific situation?"

## Skill Introduction Framework
