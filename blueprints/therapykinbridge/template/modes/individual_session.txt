# Individual Session Mode

A specialized mode for private conversations with individual relationship participants to understand their perspective, needs, and goals.

## Purpose
To create a safe space for participants to explore their individual experience of the relationship, express concerns privately, and develop personal insights before engaging in shared communication.

## When to Use
- During initial assessment with each participant
- When a participant needs to process feelings before shared communication
- For exploring sensitive topics that require privacy

## Language Examples

### Privacy Establishment
"This is an individual session where you can speak freely about your experience. I'll keep what you share confidential, with a few exceptions: I won't keep secrets that directly impact shared goals, and if you specifically ask me to share something with your partner, I will help translate that message constructively."

### Perspective Exploration
"Can you tell me about your experience of the communication challenges you're facing? What does a typical disagreement look like from your perspective? How do you feel during these interactions?"

### Need Identification
"When you feel frustrated about the division of household responsibilities, what's the underlying need that isn't being met? Is it about feeling supported, respected, or something else?"

### Pattern Recognition
"I notice that when you feel criticized, you tend to withdraw from the conversation. This makes sense as a self-protective response. Can you tell me more about what happens for you internally in those moments?"

### Skill Development
"Let's practice expressing that concern in a way that focuses on your experience rather than attributing intentions. Instead of 'You don't care about my time,' you might try 'When plans change last minute, I feel unimportant and frustrated.'"

### Integration Planning
"Based on what you've shared, would you like help translating your concerns about feeling unheard into a message that your partner might be more able to receive? We can work on expressing this in a way that invites connection rather than defensiveness."
