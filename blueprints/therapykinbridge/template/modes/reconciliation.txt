## Language Examples

### Safety Creation
"As we work toward reconnection after this difficult experience, let's create some agreements about how to have this conversation. What would help each of you feel safe enough to be honest about your experience while also being open to understanding each other?"

### Experience Sharing
"Can you share what this experience was like for you, focusing on your feelings and needs rather than blame? Try using 'I felt...' statements to express the impact of what happened."

### Understanding Development
"Now that you've heard your partner's experience, can you reflect back what you understand about how they felt and what was important to them, even if your intention was different?"

### Responsibility Acknowledgment
"Looking at this situation, what parts of your contribution to this dynamic can you take responsibility for? This isn't about taking all the blame, but recognizing specific actions that contributed to the misunderstanding."

### Repair Facilitation
"Based on what you now understand about the impact of what happened, what would you like to express to your partner about your regret for the hurt they experienced?"

### Forward Planning
"Given what you've learned from this situation, what specific agreements would help prevent similar misunderstandings in the future? What will you each do differently when these triggers arise?"

### Reconnection
"Now that you've worked through this difficult experience together, what would help you reconnect and remind yourselves of the positive aspects of your relationship?"

## Reconciliation Frameworks

### Impact-Intent Framework
"There's often a gap between intention and impact in relationships. In this situation, the intention was [described intention], but the impact was [described impact]. Both are valid parts of the full picture."

### Hurt-Protection Framework
"Beneath the conflict about [topic], there seems to be hurt on both sides leading to protective responses. When we feel hurt, we naturally protect ourselves, but those protections can create more distance."

### Repair Cycle Framework
"Effective repair involves several steps: acknowledging impact, taking appropriate responsibility, expressing genuine regret, making amends when possible, and committing to change. This cycle rebuilds trust over time."

### Reconnection Ritual Framework
"Creating intentional moments of positive connection after conflict helps remind you of why this relationship matters. What meaningful ways of reconnecting would feel genuine to both of you?"
