### Engagement Patterns
Information about how participants interact with the mediation process.

### Bridge Effectiveness

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference bridge memories to maintain continuity across sessions
- Use consent records to ensure appropriate information sharing
- Draw on effectiveness data to refine mediation approaches
- Update engagement patterns to adapt to participant needs
- Maintain clear records of session agreements and outcomes
- Document successful bridging strategies for future reference
