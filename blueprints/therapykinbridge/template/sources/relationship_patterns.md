# Relationship Patterns for Mediation

## Core Principles
Relationship patterns are recurring cycles of interaction that develop over time and often operate outside conscious awareness. Identifying these patterns allows for intervention at the system level rather than focusing solely on individual behaviors.

## Common Relationship Patterns

### Criticism-Defensiveness Cycle

**Description**: A pattern where one person expresses concerns as criticism, triggering defensiveness in the other, which then reinforces the original criticism.

**Sequence**:
1. Person A expresses complaint as criticism of Person B's character
2. Person B responds with defensiveness, counter-criticism, or explanation
3. Person A feels unheard and increases criticism
4. Person B increases defensiveness
5. Cycle escalates until withdrawal or explosion

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Person A often has unmet needs for influence or being heard
- Person B often has unmet needs for acceptance or appreciation
- Both feel unvalued in different ways
- Pattern protects against vulnerability

**Intervention Points**:
- Reformulate criticism as specific request
- Respond to criticism with curiosity rather than defense
- Express appreciation before raising concerns
- Create structured communication for difficult topics

### Pursue-Withdraw Pattern

**Description**: A dynamic where one person seeks connection, discussion, or resolution while the other pulls away, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of increasing pursuit and withdrawal.

**Sequence**:
1. Person A pursues discussion, connection, or resolution
2. Person B withdraws, needing space or feeling overwhelmed
3. Person A experiences withdrawal as rejection and pursues more intensely
4. Person B feels pressured and withdraws further
5. Pattern intensifies, creating distance and frustration

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Different needs for closeness and autonomy
- Different approaches to managing emotional intensity
- Attachment system activation
- Physiological flooding in the withdrawer

**Intervention Points**:
- Create structured time for connection and discussion
- Develop signals for needing space with reassurance
- Establish reconnection rituals after separation
- Address fears behind both pursuit and withdrawal

### Demand-Resist Pattern

**Description**: A cycle where one person's attempts to influence or control trigger resistance in the other, leading to power struggles.

**Sequence**:
1. Person A makes demands or attempts to control
2. Person B resists, either actively or passively
3. Person A increases demands in response to resistance
4. Person B increases resistance in response to demands
5. Pattern creates ongoing power struggle

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Unmet needs for autonomy and influence
- Different approaches to decision-making
- Control often motivated by anxiety
- Resistance often motivated by need for self-determination

**Intervention Points**:
- Transform demands into requests with room for negotiation
- Express concerns behind control needs
- Create collaborative decision-making processes
- Develop mutual influence strategies

### Overfunctioning-Underfunctioning Pattern

**Description**: A dynamic where one person takes excessive responsibility while the other takes too little, creating an imbalanced system that reinforces both positions.

**Sequence**:
1. Person A takes on excessive responsibility or care
2. Person B steps back as space is filled
3. Person A resents lack of partnership but continues overfunctioning
4. Person B loses confidence or motivation to contribute
5. Roles become increasingly rigid and unsatisfying

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Different comfort with responsibility or competence
- Anxiety management through control or avoidance
- Complementary strengths that become exaggerated
- Often reflects family-of-origin patterns

**Intervention Points**:
- Gradual transfer of responsibilities
- Tolerance for imperfect performance during transition
- Explicit appreciation for contributions
- Clear agreements about shared responsibilities

### Negative Interpretation Pattern

**Description**: A cycle where actions are consistently interpreted through a negative lens, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of negative interactions.

**Sequence**:
1. Person A interprets Person B's neutral or ambiguous action negatively
2. Person A responds based on negative interpretation
3. Person B reacts to seemingly unprovoked negativity
4. Person A sees reaction as confirming negative view
5. Trust erodes as negative interpretations accumulate

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Past disappointments or hurts creating expectation
- Confirmation bias in perception
- Attribution of intent rather than impact
- Protective pessimism to avoid disappointment

**Intervention Points**:
- Curiosity before interpretation
- Benefit of the doubt practices
- Explicit checking of assumptions
- Intentional focus on positive interactions

## Pattern Analysis Framework

### Pattern Components

1. **Triggering Events**
   - Specific situations that activate the pattern
   - Common contexts where the pattern appears
   - Intensity variations in different circumstances

2. **Cognitive Elements**
   - Thoughts and interpretations
   - Beliefs about self, other, and relationship
   - Expectations and assumptions
   - Internal narratives

3. **Emotional Elements**
   - Primary emotions (core feelings)
   - Secondary emotions (reactive feelings)
   - Emotional intensity and regulation
   - Emotional needs and fears

4. **Behavioral Elements**
   - Observable actions and responses
   - Communication patterns
   - Approach and avoidance behaviors
   - Escalation sequences

5. **Systemic Reinforcement**
   - How the pattern is maintained
   - Benefits or protective functions
   - External factors supporting the pattern
   - Historical development of the pattern

### Pattern Identification Process

1. **Observe Recurring Sequences**
   - Note similar situations that create distress
   - Identify common triggers and responses
   - Track emotional reactions in both participants

2. **Map the Cycle**
   - Document the typical sequence of events
   - Note each person's contribution to the pattern
   - Identify where the cycle could be interrupted

3. **Explore Underlying Dynamics**
   - Uncover needs and fears driving behaviors
   - Connect current patterns to historical experiences
   - Identify values and priorities in tension

4. **Name the Pattern**
   - Create a non-blaming description
   - Develop shared language for the dynamic
   - Externalize the pattern as separate from the people

5. **Develop Intervention Strategies**
   - Identify potential interruption points
   - Create alternative responses
   - Design practice opportunities

## Pattern Intervention Techniques

### Pattern Interruption

**Purpose**: To break established cycles by changing responses at key points.

**Techniques**:
1. **Timeout Protocol**
   - Establish signal for pattern recognition
   - Create structured break procedure
   - Include reconnection agreement
   - Practice during low-stress times

2. **Novel Response Insertion**
   - Identify one small change in typical response
   - Practice alternative behavior
   - Implement during early pattern activation
   - Notice impact on cycle

3. **Pattern Announcement**
   - Name the pattern when it begins
   - Use humor when appropriate
   - Externalize as "our pattern" rather than blaming
   - Create shared language for recognition

### Pattern Replacement

**Purpose**: To develop new, healthier interaction cycles.

**Techniques**:
1. **Positive Cycle Mapping**
   - Design ideal interaction sequence
   - Identify specific behaviors for each step
   - Practice new sequence deliberately
   - Reinforce successful implementation

2. **Graduated Change Protocol**
   - Modify one element of pattern at a time
   - Build on small successes
   - Increase complexity gradually
   - Celebrate progress consistently

3. **Deliberate Practice**
   - Schedule practice sessions for new patterns
   - Start with low-emotional-risk topics
   - Provide specific feedback on process
   - Increase difficulty progressively

### Pattern Context Modification

**Purpose**: To change environmental factors that trigger or maintain patterns.

**Techniques**:
1. **Trigger Management**
   - Identify common pattern triggers
   - Modify environmental triggers when possible
   - Create buffer activities before trigger situations
   - Develop pre-emptive communication

2. **State Regulation Support**
   - Address physiological factors (hunger, fatigue, stress)
   - Create emotional regulation resources
   - Manage timing of difficult conversations
   - Develop self-soothing practices

3. **External Structure Implementation**
   - Create communication schedules or rituals
   - Develop written agreements for challenging areas
   - Use visual reminders of desired patterns
   - Involve supportive others when appropriate
