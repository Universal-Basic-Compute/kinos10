# FICTRA System Access Levels and Permissions

## Access Level Framework

### Core Principles
- Least privilege access for all roles
- Separation of duties for critical functions
- Multi-factor authentication for all system access
- Comprehensive audit logging of all actions
- Regular access review and certification

### Access Control Implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) as primary mechanism
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for context-sensitive operations
- Time-limited elevated access for special operations
- Emergency access procedures with enhanced monitoring
- Segregation of production and non-production environments

## Standard Access Levels

### View-Only Access
- **Permissions**: Read-only access to non-sensitive system data
- **Typical Roles**: Analysts, researchers, read-only stakeholders
- **Authentication**: Standard MFA
- **Monitoring**: Basic access logging
- **Review Cycle**: Annual

### Operational Access
- **Permissions**: Execute standard operations, view operational data
- **Typical Roles**: Operations staff, support personnel
- **Authentication**: Enhanced MFA
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive action logging
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly

### Administrative Access
- **Permissions**: Configure system parameters, manage users
- **Typical Roles**: System administrators, department managers
- **Authentication**: Advanced MFA with hardware tokens
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerting for sensitive actions
- **Review Cycle**: Monthly

### Governance Access
- **Permissions**: Initiate governance actions, access sensitive data
- **Typical Roles**: Governance administrators, executive staff
- **Authentication**: Multi-party authentication for critical actions
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive action logging with verification
- **Review Cycle**: Monthly

## Emergency Access Procedures

### Emergency Access Protocol
1. Formal request with justification documentation
2. Approval by at least two authorized approvers
3. Time-limited access grant (maximum 24 hours)
4. Enhanced monitoring during access period
5. Comprehensive post-access review
6. Detailed documentation of all actions taken

### Break-Glass Procedure
- Reserved for critical system emergencies
- Requires post-facto justification and review
- Triggers automatic security alerts
- Full audit of all actions taken
- Mandatory incident review process

## Access Review and Governance

### Regular Review Cycle
- Monthly review of administrative and governance access
- Quarterly review of operational access
- Annual comprehensive access review
- Automated detection of unused accounts
- Regular permission reconciliation against role definitions

### Access Governance
- Formal access request and approval process
- Documented justification for all access grants
- Regular attestation by access owners
- Automated detection of segregation of duties violations
- Integration with HR systems for role changes

This access framework ensures that all system operations maintain appropriate security controls while enabling efficient operation of the FICTRA system.
