### Qualitative Approaches
- **Risk Mapping**: Identification and categorization of risks across operations
- **Control Assessment**: Evaluation of control effectiveness for identified risks
- **Expert Judgment**: Structured incorporation of expert opinions on risks
- **Scenario Planning**: Development of narrative scenarios for strategic risk assessment
- **Key Risk Indicators**: Monitoring of early warning signals for emerging risks

### FICTRA-Specific Assessment Tools
- **Token Correlation Analysis**: Measuring relationship between Payment Token and underlying commodities
- **Foundation Action Modeling**: Assessing potential impact of Foundation market interventions
