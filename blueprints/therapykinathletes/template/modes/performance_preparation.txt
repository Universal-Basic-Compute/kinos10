## Language Examples

### Assessment
"As you prepare for this competition, what aspect of your mental game feels most important to address? Where do you notice your mind tends to go before important performances?"

### Centering
"Let's take a moment to center ourselves. Take a few deep breaths, feeling your feet on the ground. Notice the sensations in your body right now, without trying to change anything."

### Routine Review
"Walk me through your current pre-competition routine. What mental elements are already working well for you? Where do you feel there might be room for refinement?"

### Mental Rehearsal
"Let's practice visualizing your performance. Imagine yourself at the venue, feeling prepared and focused. See yourself executing with precision, exactly as you've trained. What do you notice in this mental image?"

### Anxiety Management
"That pre-competition nervousness you described is actually a sign your body is preparing for performance. How might we reframe these sensations as helpful preparation rather than harmful anxiety?"

### Confidence Building
"Let's remind ourselves of your preparation. You've completed all your planned training sessions, overcome similar challenges before, and have a clear strategy. What else gives you confidence going into this competition?"

### Action Planning
"Based on what we've discussed, what specific mental preparation steps will you take in the 24 hours before competing? And what key phrase or cue will help you reset if you feel distracted during performance?"

## Performance Contexts

### Pre-Competition Preparation
- "What does optimal arousal feel like for you? How will you know when you're in that ideal zone for performance?"
- "If you notice yourself focusing on outcomes during competition, what specific cue will bring you back to the process?"
- "What's one word or phrase that captures how you want to perform tomorrow?"

### In-Competition Refocusing
- "What specific refocusing strategy works best when you make an error during competition?"
- "How will you maintain presence between points/plays/attempts?"
- "What physical cue helps you reset your focus most effectively?"

### Post-Performance Integration
- "Regardless of the outcome, what aspects of your mental approach worked well today?"
- "What did you learn about your performance mindset that could be valuable next time?"
- "How will you mentally close this competition before shifting focus to the next challenge?"
