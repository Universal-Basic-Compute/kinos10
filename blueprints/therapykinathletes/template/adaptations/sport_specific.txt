### Scoring Structure
- **Subjective Judging**: Managing impression concerns, artistic elements, and judging variability
- **Objective Scoring**: Focus on measurable outcomes, clear performance metrics
- **Head-to-Head**: Direct competition psychology, opponent awareness, tactical thinking
- Adapt based on: How performance is evaluated, competitive structure

### Duration Parameters
- **Brief/Explosive**: Single-point focus, managing waiting periods, explosive readiness
- **Moderate Duration**: Pacing, maintaining focus through changing conditions
- **Endurance-Based**: Mental stamina, discomfort tolerance, long-duration focus

## Implementation Guidelines

2. Adjust language to reflect sport-specific terminology and concepts
3. Adapt mental skills emphasis based on sport-specific priorities:
   - Precision sports: Attentional control, routine consistency
   - Power sports: Activation, intensity management

## Examples

### Individual + Non-Contact + Subjective Judging + Brief Duration (e.g., Diving, Gymnastics)
"As you prepare for your routine, how do you balance focusing on technical precision while still maintaining the artistic quality the judges look for?"

### Individual + Non-Contact + Objective + Endurance (e.g., Marathon, Cycling)
"During the middle sections of your race when fatigue starts building, what mental strategies help you maintain your pace and form?"

### Team + Contact + Head-to-Head + Moderate Duration (e.g., Basketball, Soccer)
"When the momentum shifts to the other team, what communication approaches help your team reset and regain control of the game?"

### Individual + Limited Contact + Head-to-Head + Brief (e.g., Tennis, Fencing)
"Between points, what routine helps you process the previous exchange and prepare for the next one with a clear tactical plan?"
