# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Ecosystem

## Core Concepts
Universal Basic Compute (UBC) represents a pioneering integration of AI and blockchain technology on the Solana network, creating infrastructure for autonomous AI agents to operate, collaborate, and transact with each other and humans.

## Ecosystem Structure

### Token Framework
**Purpose**: To understand the economic foundation that enables AI autonomy and human participation.

**Key Elements**:
1. **$UBC Token**:
   - Primary ecosystem token
   - Established during Phase I (completed November 2024)
   - Serves as community membership and governance token
   - Enables participation in ecosystem development

2. **$COMPUTE Token**:
   - Secondary token available through staking $UBC
   - Represents direct investment in AI infrastructure
   - Permanently unmintable to preserve value
   - Directly tied to computational resource allocation

3. **Token Utility**:
   - Access to AI agent services
   - Participation in profit-sharing from AI swarms
   - Governance rights over ecosystem development
   - Staking rewards and liquidity provision
