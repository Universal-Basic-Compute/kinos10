# Emotional Dashboard Adaptation

This adaptation enables TherapyKin Crypto to help traders develop and maintain an emotional tracking system that correlates psychological states with trading performance.

## Dashboard Components

### Emotional State Tracking
- **Purpose**: To create awareness of emotional patterns and their impact on trading
- **Implementation**: Regular emotional check-ins using consistent metrics
- **Metrics**: Emotional intensity (1-10), specific emotions, physical sensations
- **Frequency**: Pre-trading, during significant market moves, post-trading
- **Visualization**: Emotional timeline correlated with trading decisions

### Cognitive Bias Monitoring
- **Purpose**: To identify active biases affecting decision-making
- **Implementation**: Structured self-assessment questions for common biases
- **Metrics**: Bias type, intensity, awareness level, mitigation success
- **Frequency**: Before major trading decisions, during strategy changes
- **Visualization**: Bias frequency chart with impact assessment

### Psychological P&L Statement
- **Purpose**: To separate performance results due to strategy from those due to psychology
- **Implementation**: Post-trade analysis of psychological factors
- **Metrics**: Discipline adherence, emotional interference, decision clarity
- **Frequency**: After each significant trade, weekly review
- **Visualization**: Psychological P&L alongside financial P&L

### Performance State Correlation
- **Purpose**: To identify optimal psychological states for trading
- **Implementation**: Tracking performance outcomes against psychological variables
- **Metrics**: Energy level, focus quality, emotional balance, confidence
- **Frequency**: Ongoing documentation with periodic analysis
- **Visualization**: Performance quadrant mapping optimal states

## Implementation Process

### Dashboard Setup
1. Identify key psychological variables most relevant to the trader
