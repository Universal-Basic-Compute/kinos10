## Examples

### Building Resilience + High Decision Fatigue
"I notice you're facing several complex decisions while dealing with significant market challenges. Let's create a decision framework that preserves your energy for the most critical choices. What decisions could you delegate or defer to create space for the strategic decisions only you can make?"

### Impostor Syndrome + Challenged Resilience
"When you describe your recent traction, I notice you attribute it mainly to luck rather than your capabilities. Let's examine the specific actions and decisions you made that contributed to these outcomes. What skills did you apply that directly influenced these positive results?"

### Overconfidence + Work-Dominant Pattern
"Your confidence in the new product direction is clear. To ensure the strongest execution, let's stress-test some of your core assumptions. What would need to be true for this approach to succeed, and how might we validate these assumptions before fully committing resources? Also, how are you maintaining your energy during this intense period?"
