# Funding Strategies

## Core Principles
Effective funding strategies align capital needs with business stage and model, balance growth with founder control, and create appropriate financial runways for achieving key milestones. The best approaches consider both immediate capital requirements and long-term funding implications.

## Key Funding Sources

### Bootstrapping
**Purpose**: To build a business using personal resources and revenue without external funding.

**Key Approaches**:
- **blueprint-Funded**: Using pre-sales, deposits, or subscription models
- **Revenue-Reinvestment**: Channeling profits back into growth
- **Lean Operations**: Minimizing expenses and overhead
- **Service-to-Product**: Using service revenue to fund product development
- **Side Hustle**: Building while maintaining other income sources

**Advantages**:
- Maintains complete founder control
- Forces focus on revenue and profitability
- Builds capital-efficient culture
- No dilution or investor obligations
- Freedom to pursue non-traditional growth paths

**Considerations**:
- Potentially slower growth trajectory
- Limited ability to capture winner-take-all markets
- Personal financial risk
- Resource constraints for scaling
- Competitive vulnerability in capital-intensive markets

### Angel Investment
**Purpose**: To secure early-stage funding from individual investors, typically for pre-seed and seed stages.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Investment size typically $25K-$500K
- Often from successful entrepreneurs or executives
- Usually involves equity exchange
- Less formal process than institutional funding
- May include mentorship and connections

**Funding Vehicles**:
- **Convertible Notes**: Debt that converts to equity at next round
- **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**: Right to future equity without debt
- **Direct Equity**: Immediate ownership stake with valuation

**Best Practices**:
- Targeting angels with relevant industry experience
- Leveraging warm introductions
- Clear articulation of value proposition and traction
- Transparent communication about risks and challenges
- Appropriate legal documentation

### Venture Capital
**Purpose**: To provide significant growth capital in exchange for equity, typically for businesses with high growth potential.

**Investment Stages**:

- **Series A**: First significant round ($2M-$15M)
- **Series B**: Growth acceleration ($15M-$30M)

### Strategic Investment
**Purpose**: To secure funding from corporations with strategic interest in the startup's technology, market, or capabilities.

**Key Characteristics**:
