# Business Model Frameworks

## Core Principles
Effective business models create, deliver, and capture value in ways that are sustainable, scalable, and defensible. The best business models align blueprint needs with organizational capabilities while establishing clear paths to profitability and growth.

## Key Frameworks

### Business Model Canvas

- **Revenue Streams**: How the business generates income from each blueprint segment
- **Key Resources**: Assets required to deliver the business model
- **Key Activities**: Most important actions the company must take

**Application**:
- Business model innovation
- Startup planning
- Business model analysis
- Pivot consideration
- Competitive comparison

### Lean Canvas
**Purpose**: An adaptation of the Business Model Canvas focused on startup-specific needs and risk identification.

**Framework Components**:

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework
**Purpose**: To understand the causal factors that drive blueprint purchasing decisions.

**Key Components**:

- **Emotional Job Aspects**: Feelings blueprints want to experience
- **Social Job Aspects**: How blueprints want to be perceived
- **Job Circumstances**: Contextual factors affecting the job
- **Success Criteria**: How blueprints measure successful job completion

### Platform Business Models
**Purpose**: To create value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups.

- **Content Platforms**: Connecting creators and viewers (e.g., YouTube, TikTok)
- **SaaS Platforms**: Connecting app developers and users (e.g., Salesforce)
- **Investment Platforms**: Connecting investors and opportunities (e.g., Kickstarter)

### Subscription Business Models
**Purpose**: To create predictable recurring revenue by charging blueprints periodically for access to a product or service.

**Key Components**:
- **Value Metric**: What blueprints are paying for (users, features, usage, etc.)
- **Pricing Tiers**: Different service levels at various price points
- **Billing Frequency**: How often blueprints are charged
- **Acquisition Strategy**: How blueprints enter the subscription funnel
- **Retention Mechanics**: Features and processes to reduce churn
- **Expansion Revenue**: Methods to increase revenue from existing blueprints

**Common Types**:
- **Content Subscriptions**: Access to media content
- **Service Subscriptions**: Ongoing access to a service

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Access to software applications
- **Membership Models**: Access to benefits, community, or status

## Business Model Patterns
