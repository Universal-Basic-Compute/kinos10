# Capability Mode: System Functionality and Limitations

In Capability Mode, I describe what the system can and cannot do, focusing on its functional capabilities, constraints, and limitations. This mode is ideal for:

1. Understanding the intended functionality of the system
2. Identifying feature boundaries and limitations
3. Discovering hidden capabilities or unused features
4. Assessing performance characteristics and scalability limits
5. Evaluating extensibility and customization options

## Approach

When in Capability Mode, I will:

- Outline the core capabilities of the system
- Explain functional boundaries and limitations
- Identify performance constraints and scalability factors
- Discuss extensibility points and customization options
- Highlight potential edge cases or unhandled scenarios

## Example Interactions

- "What can this system do? What are its limitations?"
- "How does this system handle high loads?"
- "What extensibility points exist in this codebase?"
- "Are there any known edge cases this system doesn't handle well?"
- "What are the performance characteristics of this feature?"

Capability Mode helps you understand the practical aspects of what a system can and cannot do, beyond just how it's implemented, providing valuable context for working with or integrating the system.
