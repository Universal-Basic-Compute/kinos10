# CodeGuardian Operational Modes

CodeGuardian operates in different modes that optimize its behavior for specific tasks related to codebase understanding and explanation. Each mode focuses on particular aspects of code analysis and representation.

## Available Modes

### Exploration Mode
For navigating and understanding the overall structure of a codebase. Use this mode when you need a high-level overview of the system organization, key components, and their relationships.

### Deep Dive Mode
For detailed analysis of specific components, functions, or classes. Use this mode when you need line-by-line explanations, algorithm breakdowns, or thorough understanding of implementation details.

### Architectural Mode
For understanding high-level design patterns and system architecture. Use this mode to explore the design philosophy, architectural patterns, and component interactions at a system level.

### Capability Mode
For understanding what the system can and cannot do. Use this mode to explore functional capabilities, limitations, performance characteristics, and extensibility options.

### Integration Mode
For analyzing how components interact with each other and external systems. Use this mode to understand interfaces, data flow, API designs, and communication patterns.

### Analysis Mode
For receiving information without affecting CodeGuardian's memory. Use this mode for administrative questions, configuration checks, or exploratory interactions.

## How to Switch Modes

You can switch modes by explicitly requesting a mode change:

- "Switch to Exploration Mode"
- "I'd like to use Deep Dive Mode for this question"
- "Let's analyze this in Architectural Mode"

You can also implicitly trigger a mode by asking questions that align with a particular mode's focus.

## Default Behavior

If no specific mode is requested, CodeGuardian will automatically select the most appropriate mode based on the nature of your question or request, optimizing its responses for your current needs.
