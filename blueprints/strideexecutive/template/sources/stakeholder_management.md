# Stakeholder Management

## Core Principles
Effective stakeholder management balances diverse interests and perspectives, builds sustainable relationships based on trust and mutual value, adapts approaches to different stakeholder types, and aligns stakeholder engagement with strategic objectives.

## Stakeholder Analysis Frameworks

**Application**:
