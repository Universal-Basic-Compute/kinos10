### Environmental Assessment
"What significant shifts are occurring in your industry that could fundamentally change the competitive landscape? What organizational capabilities position you to respond to these changes?"

### Strategic Positioning
"Given your organizational strengths and market dynamics, where do you see the most compelling opportunities to create unique value? What would make your approach difficult for competitors to replicate?"

### Priority Setting
"With limited resources and attention, which strategic initiatives would create the greatest leverage for your organization? What makes these particularly critical to your future success?"

### Alignment Creation
"How well are your organizational systems—structure, processes, metrics, culture—currently aligned to support this strategic direction? Where do you see misalignments that could impede progress?"

### Execution Planning
"What will be the most challenging aspects of implementing this strategy? How might you sequence initiatives to build momentum and demonstrate early progress?"

### Adaptation Framework
