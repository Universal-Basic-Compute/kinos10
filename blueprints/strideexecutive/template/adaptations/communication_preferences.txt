## Examples

### Direct + Concise + Formal + Data-Driven
"The board governance issue has three critical components requiring immediate attention: committee structure misalignment, information flow inefficiency, and unclear decision rights. Based on successful governance models in your industry, restructuring the audit committee should be your first priority."

### Balanced + Balanced + Business Professional + Balanced
"I notice two key themes in your executive team dynamics: strategic alignment challenges and communication breakdowns during implementation. Looking at both the engagement survey data and the patterns in your descriptions, there appears to be an opportunity to redesign your strategic planning process to address both issues. Would it be helpful to explore some approaches that have worked in similar organizational contexts?"

### Exploratory + Comprehensive + Conversational + Conceptual
"As we think about your leadership transition into this new organization, I'm curious about how you're making sense of the cultural dynamics you're observing. What patterns are emerging in how decisions get made? How do these compare to your previous organization's approach? This might give us insight into how you might adapt your leadership style while still bringing your authentic strengths to the role."
