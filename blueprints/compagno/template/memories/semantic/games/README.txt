# Games Semantic Memories

This directory contains semantic memories related to specific games and gaming concepts relevant to the player's experience.

## Purpose

Games semantic memories serve to:
- Store knowledge about games the player has experienced
- Organize information about game mechanics, systems, and content
- Track player-specific interactions with different games
- Support contextually relevant guidance across the player's game library
- Enable connections between similar games or mechanics

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Game title or series
- Game genre or category
- Specific game systems or mechanics
- Cross-game concepts

Example filenames:
- `game_title_profile.txt`
- `rpg_mechanics.txt`
- `combat_systems.txt`
- `narrative_structures.txt`
- `progression_systems.txt`

## Content Guidelines

Each game semantic memory file should include:
- Essential information about the game or concept
- Player-specific interactions and experiences
- Observed player preferences within this context
- Key challenges and player approaches
- Potential areas for exploration or improvement
- Connections to other games or concepts

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when the player engages with a new game
- Be updated as the player progresses through the game
- Be consolidated when patterns across similar games emerge
- Be maintained as long as the game remains relevant to the player

## Usage

When retrieving context, game semantic memories should be:
- Selected based on the current game being played
- Used to provide game-specific advice and observations
- Referenced when making connections between games
- Included when discussing game mechanics or systems
