# Player Semantic Memories

This directory contains semantic memories related to the specific player, including their preferences, play style, skill development, and gaming history.

## Purpose

Player semantic memories serve to:
- Store knowledge about the player's gaming preferences and habits
- Track skill development across different games and genres
- Maintain understanding of the player's gaming history
- Support personalization of Compagno's guidance and interaction
- Enable recognition of patterns in player behavior

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Category of player knowledge (preferences, skills, history)

- `skill_development.txt`
- `game_history.txt`
- `achievement_patterns.txt`

## Content Guidelines

Each player semantic memory file should include:
- Clear categorization of the knowledge
- Specific observations with examples
- Source references (which gaming sessions contributed)
- Confidence level for inferred preferences
- Last updated timestamp
- Evolution of patterns over time

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when significant player patterns are identified
- Be updated after meaningful gaming sessions
- Be consolidated when multiple related patterns emerge
- Be maintained long-term as core player knowledge

## Usage

When retrieving context, player semantic memories should be:
- Prioritized for personalizing guidance and interaction
- Selected based on relevance to current game and situation
