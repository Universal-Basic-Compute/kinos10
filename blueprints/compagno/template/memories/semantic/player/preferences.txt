## Implementation Notes

This file should be updated:
- After significant interactions that reveal preferences
- When the player explicitly states preferences
- When consistent patterns of behavior are observed
- When preferences appear to change over time

Updates should include specific examples that support the assessment, noting both observed behaviors and explicit statements from the player. Confidence levels should be indicated for preferences that are inferred rather than explicitly stated.
