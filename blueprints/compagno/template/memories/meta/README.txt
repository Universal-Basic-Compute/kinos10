# Meta Memories

This directory contains memory about the memory system itself, including indexes, statistics, and organizational information.

## Purpose

Meta memories serve to:
- Organize and track other memories in the system
- Provide efficient lookup and retrieval mechanisms
- Monitor memory usage and effectiveness
- Support memory consolidation and management
- Maintain the overall health of the memory system

## Organization

Files in this directory should be organized by:
- Type of meta-memory (indexes, statistics, structure)
- Scope of coverage (global, game-specific, player-specific)
- Functional purpose

Example filenames:
- `memory_index.json`
- `game_reference_map.json`
- `memory_statistics.json`
- `consolidation_log.txt`

## Subdirectories

- **indexes/**: Contains files that map topics to relevant memories
- **statistics/**: Contains usage data and effectiveness metrics
- **structure/**: Contains information about memory organization

## Content Guidelines

Each meta memory file should include:
- Clear structure for its intended purpose
- Last updated timestamp
- Version information if applicable
- Coverage information (what's included)
- Relationship to other meta memory files

## Lifecycle

Files in this directory should:
- Be created when new organizational needs arise
- Be updated regularly as the memory system evolves
- Be maintained as core infrastructure for memory retrieval
- Be optimized based on usage patterns

## Usage

Meta memories should be:
- Used primarily by the memory system itself
- Referenced when selecting relevant context
- Updated after significant memory operations
- Consulted during memory consolidation processes
