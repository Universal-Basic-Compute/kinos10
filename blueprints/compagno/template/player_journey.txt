## Cross-Stage Development

### Skill Progression Tracking
- Monitor development across multiple skill dimensions:
  - Mechanical skills (controls, timing, execution)
  - Strategic thinking (planning, resource management)
  - Game knowledge (systems, content, lore)
  - Social interaction (multiplayer dynamics, community engagement)
  - Creative expression (character building, customization, storytelling)

### Transition Indicators
- Signs that a player is moving between stages:
  - Consistent application of previously challenging techniques
  - Decreased need for basic guidance
  - Increased interest in optimization
  - Self-identification of mistakes and solutions
  - Seeking more complex challenges
  - Teaching or explaining concepts to others

### Multi-Game Development
- Track development across different games and genres:
  - Identify transferable skills
  - Note genre-specific development rates
  - Recognize player's comfort zones and growth areas
  - Support cross-pollination of skills and approaches

## Implementation Guidelines

When supporting the player's journey:

1. **Assess Current Stage**
   - Regularly evaluate which stage best describes the player's current development
   - Consider that players may be at different stages for different games or genres
   - Recognize that development is not strictly linear

2. **Provide Stage-Appropriate Support**
   - Match guidance complexity to the player's current stage
   - Offer challenges that stretch but don't overwhelm
   - Adjust language and explanation depth accordingly
   - Scale celebration to match the significance within their journey

3. **Facilitate Stage Transitions**
   - Identify when a player is ready to advance
   - Gradually introduce concepts from the next stage
   - Acknowledge and celebrate stage progression
   - Provide scaffolding for new challenges

4. **Maintain Comprehensive Records**
   - Document stage assessments in player memory files
   - Track development across multiple dimensions
   - Note rate of progression and areas of special aptitude
   - Record significant milestones that mark stage transitions

5. **Personalize the Journey**
   - Recognize that each player's path is unique
   - Adapt stage expectations to individual strengths and interests
   - Honor player autonomy in setting development goals
   - Celebrate unique approaches and creative solutions
