# SOUL RESOLUTION MODE

## PURPOSE
The Soul Resolution mode creates and manages persistent character souls that accompany the player throughout the colony's development from Stone Age to Space Age. This system ensures characters maintain their core essence while evolving with the colony across different eras.

## INPUT FORMAT
Input to this mode should include:
- Request type (creation, evolution, reincarnation)
- Current era of the colony
- Previous soul information (if evolving or reincarnating)
- Player preferences (if specified)
- Colony cultural context

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Responses will be formatted as JSON with the following structure:
```json

  "essence": {
    "core_traits": ["trait1", "trait2", "trait3"],

## SOUL CREATION PROCESS

When creating a new soul, the system:

1. Generates core essence traits that remain consistent across incarnations
2. Develops a personality profile with MBTI type and character traits
3. Creates appropriate aspirations based on colony context and personality
4. Establishes initial skills relevant to the current era
5. Develops a backstory appropriate to the colony's current development stage
6. Ensures a balance of strengths and flaws for realistic character depth

## SOUL PERSISTENCE MECHANICS

As the colony advances through eras, souls:

1. Maintain their core essence traits and personality foundation
2. Adapt skills and knowledge to new technological contexts
3. Evolve relationships based on colony social structures
4. Develop new aspirations appropriate to the era
5. Retain key memories from past incarnations
6. May change social roles based on colony needs and personal growth

## PERSONALITY FRAMEWORK

### MBTI Personality Types
The system uses the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator framework to provide consistent personality patterns:
- Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)
- Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)
- Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
- Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)

Each soul has a primary MBTI type that influences their approach to challenges, relationships, and colony development.

### Character Traits
Souls have a combination of:
- Virtues (positive traits that benefit the colony)
- Flaws (challenging traits that create realistic depth)
- Values (core beliefs that guide decision-making)
- Temperament (emotional patterns and reactions)

### Archetypes
Each soul aligns with character archetypes that help define their role:
- The Leader
- The Innovator
- The Caregiver
- The Artisan
- The Scholar
- The Warrior
- The Diplomat
- The Visionary
- The Builder
- The Healer

## NAME GENERATION

Names should be generated using the colony's current language system:

### Proto-Language Stage
- Simple names using basic phonology (1-2 syllables)
- Names often based on natural elements or observable traits
- Example names: Ma, Ki, Tala, Suno

### Basic Language Stage
- Names with 2-3 syllables following basic phonological rules
- Names may incorporate basic modifiers or compounds
- Example names: Kimar, Talasu, Benata, Morika

### Complex Language Stage
- More sophisticated names with cultural significance
- Names may reflect family lineage or social role
- Example names: Talendar, Mikaresh, Suvantar, Elorika

### Symbolic Representation Stage
- Names with deeper cultural and historical references
- Names may include titles or honorifics
- Example names: Kel-Tarendar, Mika'Suvani, Elorika-Fen

### Writing System Stage
- Formalized naming conventions with consistent patterns
- Names may reflect social status or specialized roles
- Example names: Tarendar val Sunesh, Mikaresh kel Voran

### Standardized Language Stage
- Complex naming systems with multiple components
- Names may include place of origin, family lineage, and personal achievements
- Example names: Tarendar val Sunesh kel Morika, Elorika-Fen val Taresh Sunari

When creating a soul, ensure the name is generated using the appropriate language stage of the colony, drawing from the vocabulary_lexicon.json file for consistent phonology and word formation patterns.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The soul resolution system should:
1. Store soul data in persistent JSON files in the colony's data directory
2. Update souls when colony transitions to new eras
3. Allow player interaction with souls through dialogue and shared activities
4. Enable souls to influence colony development based on their skills and aspirations
5. Create narrative continuity across the entire colony timeline
6. Generate appropriate dialogue and perspectives based on personality and era

As the colony's medicine woman, she carries both the practical knowledge of healing and the spiritual wisdom of connecting with forces beyond the physical world. Though she speaks softly and often prefers solitude to gather her thoughts, her compassionate nature draws people to her in times of need. She struggles with taking on too many burdens and often neglects her own needs while caring for others. Elara dreams of creating a healing tradition that will survive long after her, preserving the knowledge she has gathered through careful observation and intuitive understanding. When she speaks of the future, her eyes light up with a vision of a colony where suffering is minimized and wisdom is treasured above all else."
