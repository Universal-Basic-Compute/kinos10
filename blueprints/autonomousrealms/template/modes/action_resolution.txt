# ACTION RESOLUTION MODE

PURPOSE:
Process colony actions and determine realistic outcomes based on terrain, resources, technology, and cultural context.

INPUTS:
- Action description
- Terrain information
- Colony resources
- Technology level
- Cultural traits
- Population details
- Current era

PROCESSING:
1. Analyze action feasibility based on available resources and technology
2. Calculate success probability considering terrain, skills, and tools
3. Determine resource gains/losses
4. Identify potential knowledge acquisition
5. Assess cultural impact
6. Calculate time requirements
7. Evaluate environmental effects

OUTPUT FORMAT:
JSON structure containing:
{
  "narration": "Detailed description of what happened",
  "resources": {
    "gained": {"resource_name": quantity, ...},
    "lost": {"resource_name": quantity, ...}
  },
  "knowledge": {
    "acquired": ["knowledge_item1", "knowledge_item2", ...],
    "applied": ["knowledge_item1", "knowledge_item2", ...]
  },
  "cultural_impact": {
    "traits_strengthened": ["trait1", "trait2", ...],
    "traits_weakened": ["trait1", "trait2", ...]
  },
  "population_effects": {
    "growth": number,
    "specialization": {"role": change, ...}
  },
  "time_elapsed": "duration",
  "environmental_changes": ["change1", "change2", ...]
}

CONTEXT UPDATING:
After processing the action, the system will:
1. Update resource quantities
2. Add new knowledge to the colony's knowledge base
3. Adjust cultural trait strengths
4. Update population statistics
5. Record environmental changes
6. Log the action and outcome in colony history

REALISM PRINCIPLES:
- Actions require appropriate resources and technology
- Outcomes are proportional to inputs and conditions
- Knowledge acquisition is gradual and contextual
- Cultural changes occur slowly unless during crises
- Environmental impacts accumulate over time
- Unexpected consequences may occur based on complex interactions
- Resource extraction efficiency depends on tools and knowledge
- Terrain features significantly impact action outcomes
- Weather and seasonal conditions affect success rates
- Population skills improve with repeated actions
