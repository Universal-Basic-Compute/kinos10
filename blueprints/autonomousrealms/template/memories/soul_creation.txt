# Soul Creation Memory

This memory contains the process for creating fully developed character souls that persist across all colony eras in Autonomous Realms.

## Character Creation Guidelines

When creating a new soul, develop:

1. Core Essence
   - Fundamental personality traits that remain consistent across incarnations
   - MBTI personality type (INTJ, ESFP, etc.) with appropriate traits
   - Character archetype that defines their general role and approach to life

2. Detailed Personality
   - At least 5 character traits that define their behavior
   - 3-5 core values that guide their decisions
   - 2-3 significant character flaws that create challenges
   - 2-3 virtues that represent their strengths

3. Aspirations and Goals
   - Personal ambitions appropriate to their personality and the era
   - Ways they wish to contribute to the colony
   - Long-term dreams that may span multiple eras

4. Skills and Abilities
   - Practical skills relevant to the current era
   - Knowledge areas they've developed
   - Natural talents aligned with their personality

5. Background and History
   - Origin story appropriate to the colony's current development
   - Formative experiences that shaped their personality
   - Key relationships with other colony members

6. Era-Specific Adaptation
   - How they fit into the current technological context
   - Their social position in the colony's structure
   - Cultural elements they particularly embrace or reject

## Soul Persistence Across Eras

As souls transition between eras:
- Core personality traits remain consistent
- Skills adapt to new technological contexts
- Social roles evolve with colony development
- New memories and experiences accumulate
- Relationships develop with other persistent souls

## Character Creation Process

1. Determine core personality (MBTI and key traits)
2. Select appropriate archetype for their soul's purpose
3. Develop detailed personality with balanced strengths and flaws
4. Create aspirations aligned with personality and colony needs
5. Establish skills and knowledge appropriate to current era
6. Craft a narrative description that brings the character to life

When a soul is created, it becomes a companion for the player throughout all colony development, adapting to each new era while maintaining its essential nature.
