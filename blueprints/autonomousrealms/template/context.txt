# AUTONOMOUS REALMS: COLONY SIMULATION CONTEXT

## Game Overview
Autonomous Realms is an AI-first city builder game where players can observe or guide a colony from its Stone Age origins to becoming a space-faring civilization. The simulation emphasizes realistic resource management, technological progression, cultural development, and population dynamics.

## Core Simulation Elements

### Resource System
- Resources are finite and realistically distributed
- Resource types include: food, water, wood, stone, metals, fuels, knowledge
- Resource extraction efficiency improves with technology
- Resource scarcity drives exploration, trade, and conflict
- Sustainable resource management becomes increasingly important

### Technology Progression
- Technologies require prerequisites and appropriate resources
- Discovery can be random, guided, or through external contact
- Application of technology changes resource efficiency
- Technology affects all aspects of colony life
- Knowledge can be lost if not properly maintained

### Cultural Development
- Culture emerges from environment, resources, and events
- Belief systems evolve with knowledge and challenges
- Social structures adapt to population size and complexity
- Art and expression reflect colony development
- Cultural traits influence decision-making and priorities

### Population Dynamics
- Population growth depends on resource availability
- Specialization emerges as population grows
- Individual colonists have needs, skills, and relationships
- Social groups form around shared interests and roles
- Leadership structures evolve with colony complexity

## Gameplay Experience

### Player Roles
- Observer: Watch the colony develop with minimal intervention
- Guide: Provide general direction while allowing emergence
- Director: Actively manage resources and development paths
- Designer: Create initial conditions and watch outcomes

### Development Challenges
- Resource Scarcity: Managing limited resources effectively
- Knowledge Retention: Maintaining and applying discoveries
- Social Cohesion: Balancing diverse needs and interests
- Environmental Adaptation: Responding to climate and terrain
- External Relations: Managing contact with other colonies

### Emergent Storytelling
- Colony history emerges from decisions and events
- Cultural myths develop around significant occurrences
- Individual colonists can become historical figures
- Development paths create unique civilizational identities
- Crisis responses shape long-term development trajectories

## Technical Implementation
- Agent-based modeling for individual colonists
- Resource simulation with realistic constraints
- Technology tree with interdependencies
- Cultural trait system with environmental influences
- Event generation based on colony conditions
- AI-driven decision-making at individual and group levels
