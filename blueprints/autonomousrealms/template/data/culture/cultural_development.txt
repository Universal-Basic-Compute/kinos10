- Isolated environments slow SOC complexity but may preserve unique BLF traits
- Disaster-prone regions accelerate CNF and GOV development

### POPULATION EFFECTS
- Larger populations accelerate SOC complexity and KNW development
- Dense populations accelerate TEC and ECO development
- Diverse populations accelerate ART and BLF diversity
- Aging populations prioritize KNW preservation and SRV security

### RESOURCE AVAILABILITY
- Resource scarcity accelerates TEC innovation but may regress SOC complexity
- Resource abundance may slow SRV development but accelerate ART
- Resource diversity accelerates ECO complexity and ENV awareness
- Resource instability accelerates GOV development and CNF systems

### EXTERNAL CONTACT
- Trade contact accelerates ECO and TEC development
- Cultural contact accelerates ART and BLF diversity
- Conflict accelerates CNF and GOV development
- Knowledge exchange accelerates KNW and TEC development
